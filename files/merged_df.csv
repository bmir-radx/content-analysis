This study involved the development of a versatile multiplexing detection platform for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. The system integrated signals from different biorecognition elements. Aptamer, antibody, and ACE2 were immobilized onto laser inscribed graphene electrodes, and detection mechanisms targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were studied under varying testing conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength). After determining the operating conditions for enhanced performance of each biosensor, a self-referencing approach was used between complementary recognition elements (i.e., possible combinations of aptamers, antibodies, and ACE2 enzyme biosensors) to evaluate the effects on accuracy of test results (i.e., risk of false-positive and false-negative results). A saliva pre-treatment protocol was developed to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 testing in human saliva using the multiplex biosensor platform. An open channel microfluidics system was designed to automatically split and channel a single saliva sample into multiple streams to the biosensors without saturation, biofouling, and pump requirement. The development of a functional and reliable multiplex biosensor system is useful for addressing longstanding needs in public health as the respiratory Coronavirus family continues its seasonal visits, which may repeat over several decades, much like the occasional visits from the influenza virus, with varying degrees of virulence.",2022

Recent studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in sewage and demonstrate a positive correlation between the concentration of viral markers and reported cases. The Coronavirus Sewershed Surveillance Project (CSSP) was a collaborative effort to monitor sewersheds for genetic indicators of COVID-19 in wastewater to provide additional, population-level information about virus circulation that is not captured by clinical testing. Untreated wastewater (influent) samples were screened weekly from select sewersheds and targeted micro-sewersheds for detection and ""true"" prevalence. Congregate facilities provided unique opportunities for study because they are controlled populations where the precise number and timing of infections can be defined. Detailed monitoring of congregate facilities will be utilized to define the precise per patient contribution and longevity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to wastewater by 1) increasing the number of facilities tested, 2) altering the frequency at which samples are collected, and 3) comparing sewershed data collected to clinical patient case data.

Samples are transported utilizing the statewide courier system established for the transport of clinical and environmental samples to the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory. After receiving wastewater samples, the UMC laboratories perform all analyses of SARS-COV-2 RNA in the sample. DHSS receives all results from UMC and meta data from collecting facilities for data analysis.

Because infected individuals may not have access to testing or may be asymptomatic and contraction can mean death, a proactive approach to detect the virus is needed to develop public health strategy to mitigate virus spread. Recent studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in sewage and demonstrate a positive correlation between the concentration of viral markers and reported cases. The Coronavirus Sewershed Surveillance Project (CSSP) was a collaborative effort to monitor sewersheds for genetic indicators of COVID-19 in wastewater to provide additional, population-level information about virus circulation that is not captured by clinical testing. Untreated wastewater (influent) samples were screened weekly from select sewersheds and targeted micro-sewersheds for detection and ""true"" prevalence. Congregate facilities provided unique opportunities for study because they are controlled populations where the precise number and timing of infections can be defined. Detailed monitoring of congregate facilities will be utilized to define the precise per patient contribution and longevity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to wastewater by 1) increasing the number of facilities tested, 2) altering the frequency at which samples are collected, and 3) comparing sewershed data collected to clinical patient case data. Although SARS-CoV-2 contribution/patient varies among communities, there have been clear outlier communities that produce little or no genetic material in the wastewater despite the presence of known outbreaks. The reason for this lost signal is not known, so factors that contribute to SARS-CoV-2 signal suppression in wastewater were defined by 1) defining the physical nature of the genetic material in the sewershed to better understand the types of factors that could suppress signal, 2) expanding testing within sewersheds with suppressed signal as well as from additional facilities with similar population and industry demographics as those with suppressed signal to narrow the sources of signal suppression, 3) performing exhaustive chemical characterization comparing wastewater from locations that are suppressed to those that are not to identify candidate compounds that could be causing suppression, and 4) obtaining or generating candidate inhibitors and testing their ability to suppress signal from viral genetic material in a controlled experimental setting. The utility of using wastewater RNA to determine what viral variants are circulating in a community was further examined. Towards this the research team: 1) evaluated different methods for characterizing genetic material in wastewater such as variant specific qPCR and targeted high throughput sequencing, 2) developed methods for evaluating existing and emerging variants from wastewater, and 3) designed platforms for communicating wastewater variant results to the public.",2021

This relied on integrating innovative SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity with novel community-specific messaging and education. Compounded by long-standing health disparities and socioeconomic challenges, NHPIs suffer from increased infection and mortality rates attributed to COVID-19. To date, NHPIs rank among the highest disproportionately burdened by SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. With the nation's highest Rt, a basic reproductive metric indicating the degree of viral spread, Hawaii's disaggregated NHPI data reveal further disparities. Preliminary testing data collected by the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center (WCCHC), Hawaii's largest federally funded community health center, indicated a significant deficiency in testing uptake, especially among Pacific Islanders. Under-representative coverage of testing among youth (ages 5-19 years old) in NHPI communities was observed, despite their higher than average infection rate. Other factors, including slow testing turnaround time and untested asymptomatic cases, complicated efforts to contain further community spread. Given the looming public health concerns around the re-opening of businesses and schools, these gaps highlighted the critical need for innovative approaches to effecting behavioral change coupled with novel testing strategies to enhance access to all community members, including school-aged children/youth. Fortunately, existing partnerships in Hawaii's culturally diverse populations offered a unique opportunity to augment the COVID-19 response with community knowledge and resilience. It was hypothesized that community-contextualized messaging disseminated by novel healthcare-school partnerships, coupled with a robust community and patient-centered testing strategy, would increase reach, access, uptake, and impact for COVID-19 testing in vulnerable populations. To test this hypothesis, the multidisciplinary team: (1) evaluated SARS-CoV-2 testing data, identified gaps and barriers in testing, and augmented community testing capacity to increase uptake, and (2) optimized and implemented community-informed COVID-19 messaging and education with a novel community healthcare-school network partnership in the NHPI population across Hawaii. Building on the parent ""Ola HAWAII"" grant, this project leveraged existing Community Engagement, Biostatistics, and Administrative Cores with the NHIP partnerships to augment the RADx-UP Coordinating and Data Collection Center for common evaluation metrics on COVID-19 testing-related outcomes and implementation. This project provided the foundation for an engaged community network primed for disseminating anticipated vaccines in Hawaii's highest risk populations.

The ideal surveillance tool would operate in the background with minimal involvement of the population to be tested; it would be simple, affordable, reliable, and accurate. Unfortunately, no such assay existed. This project examined a smart mask that changes colors when the wearer has been exposed to biomarkers (proteases) of COVID-19 -- a novel approach to surveillance because most people are already wearing masks, especially in high-risk settings. The first goal was to optimize the reagents that will test the proteases. The peptide sequences were customized such that the reagents change color only when two key SARS proteases were present. After characterizing the colorimetric reagents, Aim 2 integrated these reagents into an adhesive test strip that can be affixed to any existing cloth or surgical mask. Aim 3 involved validation with human subjects. First, biobanked saliva samples that were confirmed to be either COVID-19-positive or COVID-19-negative were used. Next, how long people infected with SARS-CoV-2 must breathe through the smart mask before it changed color was evaluated. Finally, the smart mask was used for surveillance of a population that was concurrently being tested regularly via PCR.

UM deployed an elaborate human surveillance testing, tracking, and tracing (3T) system to monitor the student body, faculty, and staff. The 3T system included a major hospital that is part of UM and that treats COVID-19 patients. To augment the COVID-19 monitoring system, UM deployed a pilot wastewater surveillance program for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from clusters of buildings on campus. Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) is located in New York City, NY, an area that (at the time of study) had one of the worst outbreaks of COVID-19. WCM established an international consortium for SARS-CoV-2 environmental surveillance, including in NYC and globally with the MetaSUB Consortium, which created metagenomic and metatranscriptomic maps of the world's sewage. Based on this work at both UM and WCM, the aim of the project was to develop, implement, and demonstrate effective and predictive wastewater surveillance by optimizing sampling, concentration, and detection strategies. Working closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), work under application SF-RAD included the development and implementation of data standards and informatics infrastructure and performing integrative analyses that made all data, results, and models available to the community, thus providing a critical contribution to the national SARS-COV-2 RADx-rad Wastewater Detection Consortium. The objectives were addressed through three aims. Aim 1: Data Standardization, focused on developing and implementing data standards and quality metrics, and establishing the operational infrastructure to manage SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based surveillance datasets and metadata. Aim 2: Wastewater Characterization, focused on optimizing wastewater surveillance protocols and parameters for wastewater sampling, sample concentration, and viral detection technologies. Aim 3: Integration with Human Health Surveillance, focused on metatranscriptomic analyses and on the integration of wastewater quantification data with community and hospital COVID-19 prevalence, to develop predictive models to detect local and community level spread of COVID-19.

Assessment of the true burden of disease in the population is needed for the prevention and mitigation of this and future viral disease outbreaks. Testing of new cases (via swabs/saliva) and those previously exposed (via serum) has limited reach in the population. However, an alternative approach relying on the analysis of community wastewater can screen up to 70% of the U.S. population on a weekly basis at < 0.01% of the cost of clinical screening of individuals. As a population-wide infectious disease surveillance tool, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used to complement current surveillance methods to better understand disease burden and how these burdens differ across communities. The goal of this RADx-rad supplement was to implement and evaluate a near real-time WBE framework for SARS-CoV-2 by (i) assessing in near real-time community spread of the new coronavirus, (ii) significantly increasing the fraction of the U.S. population screened, the frequency at which this testing is being completed (weekly) and the geospatial resolution of screening (from city-wide to neighborhood-specific), (iii) comparing novel coronavirus levels in wastewater with the burdens of infection, disease, and mortality reported by local health systems, (iv) harvesting high throughput sequence (HTS) data on SARS-CoV-2 variants across the U.S., (v) optimizing pipelines for HTS analysis, and (vi) immediately sharing any new knowledge gained with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center (DCC), research community, and the general public via an expansion of the online dashboard that was pioneered by the team in collaboration with the City of Tempe, AZ. Previously developed, peer-reviewed strategies were leveraged for population-wide virus monitoring via reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), HTS, sequence analysis, and data communication originally developed for the parent award to quickly provide a data stream and scientific resource for managing the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. In Aim 1, a wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) bioinformatics framework for SARS-CoV-2 was developed at the national, city, and intra-sewershed or neighborhood-level to produce RT-qPCR and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq data for studying the distribution of viral levels and genetic polymorphisms in the community.

Assessment of the true burden of disease in the population is needed for the prevention and mitigation of this and future viral disease outbreaks. Testing of new cases (via swabs/saliva) and those previously exposed (via serum) has limited reach in the population. However, an alternative approach relying on the analysis of community wastewater can screen up to 70% of the U.S. population on a weekly basis at < 0.01% of the cost of clinical screening of individuals. As a population-wide infectious disease surveillance tool, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used to complement current surveillance methods to better understand disease burden and how these burdens differ across communities. The goal of this RADx-rad supplement was to implement and evaluate a near real-time WBE framework for SARS-CoV-2 by (i) assessing in near real-time community spread of the new coronavirus, (ii) significantly increasing the fraction of the U.S. population screened, the frequency at which this testing is being completed (weekly) and the geospatial resolution of screening (from city-wide to neighborhood-specific), (iii) comparing novel coronavirus levels in wastewater with the burdens of infection, disease, and mortality reported by local health systems, (iv) harvesting high throughput sequence (HTS) data on SARS-CoV-2 variants across the U.S., (v) optimizing pipelines for HTS analysis, and (vi) immediately sharing any new knowledge gained with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center (DCC), research community, and the general public via an expansion of the online dashboard that was pioneered by the team in collaboration with the City of Tempe, AZ.

However, severe illnesses including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill with a 2-4% mortality rate. Currently, there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can impact disease severity by altering immune response and cytokine regulation which may be detected in body fluids including saliva. The long-term goal of this study was to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. The central hypothesis was that a model that integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health would predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This central hypothesis was pursued through four specific, phased aims. The first two aims from the R61 phase were: 1) Defining and comparing the salivary molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non-severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Developing and validating a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children. The R33 phase pursued the following two aims: 3) Development of a portable, rapid device that quantifies salivary miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Development of an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. The above aims were pursued using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics, analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. This research is significant because development of a sensitive model to risk stratify disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection via early recognition and timely intervention.

However, severe illnesses including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill with a 2-4% mortality rate. Currently, there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can impact disease severity by altering immune response and cytokine regulation which may be detected in body fluids including saliva. The long-term goal of this study was to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. The central hypothesis was that a model that integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health would predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This central hypothesis was pursued through four specific, phased aims. The first two aims from the R61 phase were: 1) Defining and comparing the salivary molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non-severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Developing and validating a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children. The R33 phase pursued the following two aims: 3) Development of a portable, rapid device that quantifies salivary miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Development of an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. The above aims were pursued using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics, analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. This research is significant because development of a sensitive model to risk stratify disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection via early recognition and timely intervention.

The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolving that there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients nor are there tools to predict disease progression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), clinical data and samples were collected to support the proposed studies. First, transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses were generated. These data were used to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing the established collaboration with Columbia University, the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses was defined and how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C was determined. The first two years (R61) built on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work leveraged already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/No-Go criteria were established and used to determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) focused on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data were deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity. The synergistic expertise of these investigative teams in this multi-center proposal provided a unique opportunity to create diagnostic and prognostic tools for children suffering from the spectrum of SARS- CoV-2 illnesses. Public Health Relevance: As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved in early 2020, case reports appeared describing children with unusual febrile illnesses with elevated inflammatory markers and multi-system involvement that is now termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The illness occurs weeks following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and these children have a wide spectrum of disease severity ranging from cardiogenic shock to milder illness that can be self-limited. To address an urgent, unmet clinical need, investigative teams across three countries joined forces to discover and validate a diagnostic test to identify children with MIS-C and predict progression of disease.",2022

The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolving that there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients nor are there tools to predict disease progression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), clinical data and samples were collected to support the proposed studies. First, transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses were generated. These data were used to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing the established collaboration with Columbia University, the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses was defined and how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C was determined. The first two years (R61) built on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work leveraged already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/No-Go criteria were established and used to determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) focused on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data were deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity.

Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), clinical data and samples were collected to support the proposed studies. First, transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses were generated. These data were used to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing the established collaboration with Columbia University, the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses was defined and how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C was determined. The first two years (R61) built on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work leveraged already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/No-Go criteria were established and used to determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) focused on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data were deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity.

The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolving that there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients nor are there tools to predict disease progression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), clinical data and samples were collected to support the proposed studies. First, transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses were generated. These data were used to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing the established collaboration with Columbia University, the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses was defined and how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C was determined. The first two years (R61) built on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work leveraged already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/No-Go criteria were established and used to determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) focused on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data were deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity.

Some children and young adults who have had COVID-19 develop this rare disease about a month after they recover. It can be serious, as it causes inflammation in various organs, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and intestines. MIS-C has symptoms similar to several diseases, including COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease, making diagnosis difficult. Currently, patients must undergo a battery of tests in order to diagnose MIS-C, including bloodwork, x-rays, and echocardiograms, which can take several days, delay treatment, and subject parents and children to the anxiety that's associated with an undiagnosed, concerning illness. The new diagnostic test used an existing invention, a Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) chip. It's a small gold chip that can analyze up to 400 biomarkers at once, whereas common methods are only able to analyze one biomarker at a time. The hope was to identify biomarkers that are only present, or are present in higher or lower numbers, when someone has MIS-C. The ability to include multiple biomarkers on one chip was very powerful, as several biomarkers were likely involved with this disease.

This gap-in-knowledge were addressed to develop and implement novel pandemic strategies to keep open rural essential workplaces, such as coal mines. The long-term goal of the study was to mitigate the spread of the pandemic in miners, a population of high-risk, rural essential workers who are susceptible and vulnerable to COVID-19, and who are predominantly racial/ethnic minorities in New Mexico (NM). The study objective was to provide proof-of-principle for frequent point-of-care molecular testing as a workplace surveillance tool to monitor and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this unique population. The central hypothesis was that frequent workplace molecular surveillance is an effective method to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and discover novel host risk factors. The site of molecular surveillance (intervention site) was a surface mine in McKinley County, NM, located just outside the Navajo Nation, comprised of 66% minority miners. Miners at the intervention site will provide nasal swabs every alternate work shift, which were analyzed with the Abbott ID Now, COVID-19 test, i.e., the 'index' test. The control mine located at Campbell County, Wyoming, has similar mine characteristics as the intervention mine. The rationale for this study was to establish the suitability of longitudinal molecular surveillance to prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 infection in this unique population by completing the following aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine the acceptance rate to frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance among miners. Hypothesis 1: Miners will have a cumulative acceptance rate of frequent testing at 85%, with the added objective of exploring difference in acceptance by miner characteristics. Specific Aim 2: To determine the ability to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance in a real-world setting of miners. Hypothesis 2: The sensitivity of the index test in a real-world study setting is a) comparable to that described by others in controlled settings, and b) positively associated with viral load in upper respiratory specimens. Specific Aim 3: To determine the effectiveness and implementation costs of frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance on reducing incident infection rates of SARS-CoV-2. Hypothesis 3A: Frequent point-of-care molecular testing over six months in the intervention mine will result in lower incident seropositivity rates compared to the control mine. Hypothesis 3B: Frequent point-of-care molecular surveillance in the intervention mine is cost-effective compared to the control mine. Specific Aim 4: To determine novel predictive host factors associated with incident SARS-CoV-2 infection in miners. Hypothesis 4: Miners with incident infection demonstrate less frequent use of cloth face coverings outside the workplace, greater mine dust exposure intensity, presence of dust-related lung disease, and racial/ethnic minority status than those not infected. Successful completion of the study established the acceptability and effectiveness of the proposed surveillance in work settings where common occupational mitigation strategies were not possible. Findings from this study provided broad-reaching implications for novel pandemic strategies to keep rural essential workplaces open.

Central to the state's extreme vulnerability is the high prevalence of obesity, cardiovascular disease including hypertension, chronic lung disease due to smoking and environmental exposure (e.g., mining), diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Additionally, WV is among the three states having the highest proportion of persons >age 65 years (20%). Through school and university closures in March 2020, along with shutdown of non-essential businesses, WV had relatively few COVID-19 cases and deaths until July 2020 when transmissibility (Rt) skyrocketed. Testing remains problematic in WV for multiple reasons, including inadequate testing supplies, accessibility to testing sites (given the rurality of the state and lack of widespread public transportation), shortages of personal protective equipment for staff, and lack of insurance coverage for surveillance testing and for uninsured persons. The West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) submitted this application in partnership with multiple organizations with which they have existing collaborative relationships, including: 1) the WV Practice Based Research Network (PBRN), a 107 site primary care network spanning the state, 2) the WV Department of Health and Human Resources, 3) the WV National Guard, 4) West Virginia University (WVU) Health Sciences Center and College of Engineering, and 5) the Communities of Color. Vulnerable populations included individuals in rural communities and African American populations as well as those with comorbidities known to increase risk of severe COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of substance use disorder (SUD) in WV, a cross-cutting theme was ensuring persons with SUD are included in all proposed strategies to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Unfortunately, URM and other vulnerable communities remain profoundly under-tested. As such, new approaches are needed to disseminate and accomplish testing that could be generalized across the US. New Jersey can serve as a unique, virtual testing laboratory, ranking 11th in the US in population, 2nd in the US (after NY) in the per capita rate of COVID-19 deaths, and 5th in total cases, while representing a highly diverse state with substantial Black and Latinx minority populations. Rutgers has assembled cohorts of healthcare workers (HCWs) to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and to enroll subjects for clinical and vaccine trials. While building these cohorts, it was recognized that many URMs serve as HCWs or personal care aides often in lower-income roles, and these workers were more often infected compared with those with higher income occupations. Given these observations, it is posited that HCWs in occupations at lower incomes would facilitate testing among their households and their communities. In a sense, these HCWs served as ambassadors to catalyze community-based COVID-19 testing. NJ HEROES TOO (New Jersey Healthcare Essential WoRker Outreach and Education Study - Testing Overlooked Occupations) proposed to approach URM HCWs who have been identified as index individuals who will act as ambassadors to help expand testing in their households and extended networks. In Aim 1, an innovative, HCW-centric outreach intervention strategy was (co-)designed, developed, and implemented to engage Black and Latinx minority communities. Community perceptions about COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination were explored to design COVID-19 testing materials and messages that were culturally tailored to address concerns of Black and Latinx minority communities. In Aim 2, a mixed methods study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost of: (1) the HCW-focused outreach intervention strategy versus (2) standard community engaged outreach, working with community based organizations (CBOs). Contextual factors (individual, family, and community) affecting COVID-19 testing implementation outcomes and scalability were explored. The primary outcome was uptake of COVID-19 testing in the targeted populations. The novel Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory/RUCDR saliva test, the first FDA-authorized diagnostic test using saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 for non-invasive, home based self-testing was used. The hypothesis was that a participatory outreach strategy approach focused on identified index HCWs would mobilize quicker uptake of testing within community settings than best-practice CBO recruitment approaches. It was also hypothesized that recruitment through index HCWs would be more successful for hard to reach participants compared to a traditional CBO approach.

Unfortunately, URM and other vulnerable communities remain profoundly under-tested. As such, new approaches are needed to disseminate and accomplish testing that could be generalized across the US. New Jersey can serve as a unique, virtual testing laboratory, ranking 11th in the US in population, 2nd in the US (after NY) in the per capita rate of COVID-19 deaths, and 5th in total cases, while representing a highly diverse state with substantial Black and Latinx minority populations. Rutgers has assembled cohorts of healthcare workers (HCWs) to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and to enroll subjects for clinical and vaccine trials. While building these cohorts, it was recognized that many URMs serve as HCWs or personal care aides often in lower-income roles, and these workers were more often infected compared with those with higher income occupations. Given these observations, it is posited that HCWs in occupations at lower incomes would facilitate testing among their households and their communities. In a sense, these HCWs served as ambassadors to catalyze community-based COVID-19 testing. NJ HEROES TOO (New Jersey Healthcare Essential WoRker Outreach and Education Study - Testing Overlooked Occupations) proposed to approach URM HCWs who have been identified as index individuals who will act as ambassadors to help expand testing in their households and extended networks. In Aim 1, an innovative, HCW-centric outreach intervention strategy was (co-)designed, developed, and implemented to engage Black and Latinx minority communities. Community perceptions about COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination were explored to design COVID-19 testing materials and messages that were culturally tailored to address concerns of Black and Latinx minority communities. In Aim 2, a mixed methods study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost of: (1) the HCW-focused outreach intervention strategy versus (2) standard community engaged outreach, working with community based organizations (CBOs). Contextual factors (individual, family, and community) affecting COVID-19 testing implementation outcomes and scalability were explored. The primary outcome was uptake of COVID-19 testing in the targeted populations. The novel Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory/RUCDR saliva test, the first FDA-authorized diagnostic test using saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 for non-invasive, home based self-testing was used. The hypothesis was that a participatory outreach strategy approach focused on identified index HCWs would mobilize quicker uptake of testing within community settings than best-practice CBO recruitment approaches. It was also hypothesized that recruitment through index HCWs would be more successful for hard to reach participants compared to a traditional CBO approach. The strategy focusing on HCWs could easily be expanded to other front-line and essential workers, making the strategy generalizable and sustainable.",2021

Although this highly contagious virus has infected millions of Americans, the disease burdens are disproportionately born to historically underserved populations such as Latinx communities. Nationally, Latinx people with COVID-19 are hospitalized at four times the rate of Whites and have much higher rates of morbidity and mortality. This disparity is notable in Oregon, where the 13% of the population that is Latinx represents approximately 44% of COVID-19 cases. An urgent need exists to reach Oregon's Latinx community with public health and prevention messages to increase testing. This project implemented a culturally-tailored community outreach and testing program to increase the reach, access, and uptake of testing in Latinx communities in Oregon. The project brought together a world-class team of prevention scientists, public health experts, Latinx researchers, community partners, and biologists who have been working together to conduct SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing since March, soon after the pandemic first arrived in the U.S. This team established a CLIA-certified laboratory and honed molecular testing protocols, hired and trained laboratory personnel and a field research team, procured diagnostic testing equipment and supplies, and partnered with county public health offices and hospitals throughout the state to conduct testing. The team also conducted a comprehensive community assessment using community-based participatory methods to gather Latinx community feedback on modes of communication, health messages, and testing protocols, and staffed multiple county-led testing sites serving Latinx communities. Using these resources and expertise as a foundation, a two-arm randomized controlled trial implemented community-level interventions to increase testing rates and health behaviors. Thirty-nine testing sites across 9 counties were randomized to receive one of two outreach interventions, Basic Outreach versus Promotores de Salud. Promotores de Salud was a culturally-informed intervention that included psychoeducation about COVID-19, motivational strategies, emotional support, and information support to engage individuals to attend a testing site. In addition, the study included a booster intervention for those who attend a Promotoras de Salud testing site. In the booster intervention, participants received an in-person Promotores de Salud intervention and a written pamphlet with information about health behaviors. Participants randomized to the control condition only received the written pamphlet. Participants in the research study were assessed via a survey at the time of testing and 1 month later. Site- and community-level assessments occurred at three timepoints in the study: immediate, mid-term, and primary outcomes, to measure the effects of the randomization and the on-site promotores intervention. Individual-level data were collected from 1,200 participants at two timelines when they were at a testing visit, and approximately one month later. Over time, this project helped communities institutionalize optimal local testing frameworks supported by laboratory facilities for testing capacity, technical support for testing logistics, and collection of data on health behaviors, testing rates, and sustainability.

This disparity is notable in Oregon, where the 13% of the population that is Latinx represents approximately 44% of COVID-19 cases. An urgent need exists to reach Oregon's Latinx community with public health and prevention messages to increase testing. This project implemented a culturally-tailored community outreach and testing program to increase the reach, access, and uptake of testing in Latinx communities in Oregon. The project brought together a world-class team of prevention scientists, public health experts, Latinx researchers, community partners, and biologists who have been working together to conduct SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing since March, soon after the pandemic first arrived in the U.S. This team established a CLIA-certified laboratory and honed molecular testing protocols, hired and trained laboratory personnel and a field research team, procured diagnostic testing equipment and supplies, and partnered with county public health offices and hospitals throughout the state to conduct testing. The team also conducted a comprehensive community assessment using community-based participatory methods to gather Latinx community feedback on modes of communication, health messages, and testing protocols, and staffed multiple county-led testing sites serving Latinx communities. Using these resources and expertise as a foundation, a two-arm randomized controlled trial implemented community-level interventions to increase testing rates and health behaviors. Thirty-nine testing sites across 9 counties were randomized to receive one of two outreach interventions, Basic Outreach versus Promotores de Salud. Promotores de Salud was a culturally-informed intervention that included psychoeducation about COVID-19, motivational strategies, emotional support, and information support to engage individuals to attend a testing site. In addition, the study included a booster intervention for those who attend a Promotoras de Salud testing site. In the booster intervention, participants received an in-person Promotores de Salud intervention and a written pamphlet with information about health behaviors. Participants randomized to the control condition only received the written pamphlet. Participants in the research study were assessed via a survey at the time of testing and 1 month later. Site- and community-level assessments occurred at three timepoints in the study: immediate, mid-term, and primary outcomes, to measure the effects of the randomization and the on-site promotores intervention. Individual-level data were collected from 1,200 participants at two timelines when they were at a testing visit, and approximately one month later. Over time, this project helped communities institutionalize optimal local testing frameworks supported by laboratory facilities for testing capacity, technical support for testing logistics, and collection of data on health behaviors, testing rates, and sustainability. The resulting structures and systems were poised for future scale-up to other vulnerable communities and/or for other public health purposes (e.g., vaccination campaigns).

In New York City (NYC), one of the most affected cities in the U.S., Black and Latinx communities suffered the highest rates of hospitalizations and mortality from COVID-19. Age-adjusted death rates for Blacks are more than twice those for Whites across the U.S. Data suggest that this may even represent a gross underestimate of the magnitude of the mortality from COVID-19 because Blacks and Latinx are less likely than their White counterparts to be tested for COVID-19. Delayed testing and lack of testing among high-risk individuals significantly increases the spread of the virus, and is associated with reduced ability to access life-saving treatment. Without an understanding of the complex and interrelated factors that occur at multiple levels of influence, existing testing strategies may fail to serve populations most vulnerable to COVID-19 morbidity, particularly poor and minority populations. As such, partnerships with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), where most Blacks and Latinx people receive care, are urgently needed. The FHCs at NYULH, which is the nation's second largest network of FQHCs, is a unique platform to address this problem. This three-phase study employed a multipronged, sequential mixed methods design (i.e., one methodology builds on the findings of the other) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the multilevel factors that drive uptake of testing (and vaccination) for COVID-19 in Black and Latinx patients (primary outcome), and participation in follow-up care offered by safety-net health systems. Phase 1 leveraged the FHC electronic health record (EHR) database to quantitatively examine individual-level sociodemographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors associated with receiving a PCR test for COVID-19 among 400 Black and Latinx patients who receive care at the FHCs. This phase also captured the community- and structural-level determinants of testing using validated self-report measures (RADX-UP Common Data Elements, NIH PhenX Toolkit) among the same patients (Aim 1). In Phase 2, the data sources from Phase 1 were coupled with qualitative data (e.g., focus groups, ethnographic observation, and document analysis) to capture organizational and ethical issues to shed light on important social, cultural, and contextual factors associated with uptake of COVID-19 testing and potential vaccine (Aim 2). In partnership with the Community Oversight Task Force (COTF), in Phase 3, data obtained from Phases 1 and 2 were integrated and used to refine, test, and disseminate data governance guidelines, and tailored toolkits about COVID-19 testing and vaccines (Aim 3). This study contributed to the scientific knowledge about the testing attitudes and behaviors of vulnerable communities to lay the foundation for implementing outreach strategies to increase the delivery of timely testing and follow-up among minority communities in the short-term and generate important data for large-scale COVID-19 testing and vaccination initiatives in the long-term.",2021

The Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science (LA CaTS) Center provided the essential infrastructure and key foundational support for biomedical research in this region; it was uniquely positioned to lead a community-engaged testing research project to determine differences in COVID-19 testing rates between community-based (churches, community centers, and schools) and medical clinic-based testing sites, and determine approaches that would increase uptake of testing in underserved Black communities in the South. These issues were addressed using a two-pronged approach. First, a community based participatory research approach was applied to determine differences in SARS-CoV-2 testing rates across distinct types of test sites within five urban underserved Black communities in the American South. A multimedia campaign was used to promote and conduct real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on salivary samples obtained from 2,000-3,000 adults at 1) medical clinics, 2) schools, 3) community centers, and 4) churches (in random order) within five ZIP codes with known low socioeconomic status (SES) and a high representation of Black residents. The primary outcome was the number of tests performed at each type of test site. Information on age, sex, race, height, weight, employment, and household income, etc. was collected to identify important correlates of testing rates. Second, the strong and well-integrated partnership with the Baton Rouge Mayor's Healthy City Initiative (HealthyBR) was further leveraged together with the LA CaTS Community Advisory Boards (CABs) to conduct community-based focus groups, to obtain qualitative data about the perceptions and attitudes related to testing access and potential barriers affecting such. This information was used to determine community-driven approaches that are effective in reducing barriers and to create strategies to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake in urban underserved Black communities. Results of this project greatly increased understanding of the factors that have led to a disproportionate COVID-19 health burden in these underserved populations and lay the groundwork for developing strategies to reduce these disparities in all underserved Black communities. Resulting data informed the equitable deployment of future virus/flu testing and a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",2023

These conditions are a product of, and are exacerbated by, historical and ongoing discrimination and inequities in access to healthcare. In early 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recognized as a global pandemic. To date, no data exists on COVID-19 disease in TG people. There is an urgent need to understand the burden of COVID-19 disease, investigate its impact on other health conditions and vulnerabilities burdening TG populations, and identify future public health intervention targets. This project aimed to fill this gap. To accomplish these goals, disparities in access to testing among TG people were identified and mitigated. The parent LITE study enrolled a baseline sample of more than 1,500 TG women in the eastern and southern U.S. to assess HIV risk across 24 months of biobehavioral follow-up using technology-enhanced, digital methods of data capture. Leveraging the LITE infrastructure and in partnership with two community-based organizations, this research aided in the development of LITE-CONNECT, a rapid, community-engaged mixed-methods assessment that enrolled over 2,000 TG men and women across the U.S. The objective of this supplemental study was to characterize access and barriers to COVID-19 testing, provide access to and evaluate the use of home-based COVID-19 antibody testing to identify past infection and potential immunity, connect TG men and women to available community-based COVID-19 testing and support services, and identify community-based solutions to support access to COVID-19 testing, interventions, and care among TG people. Results from this study were rapidly used to inform community-based efforts and national COVID-19 response that were inclusive of TG people. The research provided critical and timely insights about COVID-19 disease in TG people in a space in which almost no information currently exists. Early identification of disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and in access to COVID-19 testing and care was critical to ensuring access to services as the pandemic continues. Existing infrastructure and community collaborations were leveraged to gather new data, including unprecedented data from TG men, to guide urgently needed interventions to improve and optimize the health and wellbeing of TG people in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",2022

Following a Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) orientation, this project: (a) identified and prioritized testing deserts, (b) coordinated testing at different levels of the social ecosystem, (c) engaged and trained local Community Health Workers (CHWs) to deliver saliva-based COVID-19 testing to vulnerable and underserved community members, (d) delivered test results within 72 hours, (e) provided wrap-around services and provider referrals for those testing positive, and (f) sustained the intervention during a follow-up period. EHF serves as the lead community partner and convener of a growing COVID- 19 Coalition of Communities of Color Partners (CCCCP) from across Arizona. The ASU Biodesign Clinical Testing Laboratory (ABCTL) provided the saliva-based SARS-CoV-1 molecular diagnostic. The saliva test's main benefits are: a) minimal to no PPE requirements compared to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs; b) convenience and economy of specimen collection; c) ease of repeat sampling; d) administration by minimally trained CHWs, and e) greater sensitivity and consistency of saliva tests than NP swabs. Under this project, 29,000 saliva tests were administered, 10,000-12,000 at identified testing deserts during the launching period, doubling the numbers during the follow-up period in Year 1, and 5,000 tests were added in Year 2. A longitudinal evaluation assessed the intervention's impact by comparing randomly selected participants in the R.A.P.I.D. intervention during the launching period (N=500) with a matched comparison group (N=500) randomly selected from standard testing sites.",2022

Between a shortage in testing and unidentified asymptomatic individuals, the actual number of those infected could be 6 to 24-fold higher than that reported. SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the virus underlying the disease, results in a range of symptoms; in select cases a severe respiratory illness that impedes breathing could lead to hospitalization and death. CoV-2 is transmitted person-to-person via inhalation of the virus through mucosal membranes of the nose and throat from transfer after touching a contaminated surface or by inhaling aerosolized virus. Unfortunately, COVID-19 was likely to be prevalent well into 2021 and beyond. The ability to test for CoV-2 must be increased. First, testing is needed to diagnose individuals that are symptomatic or asymptomatic to reduce community spread. And second, monitoring gathering areas for airborne virus that could inform the decision to shutdown a space or implement disinfection and mitigation of an area. This study examined an electrochemical biosensor in two detection devices, 1) a diagnostic breathalyzer for instant detection of CoV-2 and 2) an airborne detector for real-time, continuous surveillance of a large space. A novel ultra-sensitive, antibody-based electrochemical biosensor to detect CoV-2 repeat binding domain (RBD) spike protein was developed. The technology was based on a micro-immunoelectrode (MIE) biosensor pioneered by the Cirrito laboratory to study protein dynamics in the setting of neurodegeneration. The biosensor used voltammetry to measure the oxidation of tyrosine amino acids; oxidation was the release of electrons that the biosensor measures as a change in current. Antibodies were covalently attached to the electrode surface to provide selectivity. This prototype CoV-2 biosensor was sensitive to 2 femtogram/ml, compared to several current CoV-2 antigen tests that are sensitive to the low picogram/ml range. The proposal (Aim 1) optimized the CoV-2 biosensor to detect CoV-2 viral particles, as well as test several parameters to increase sensitivity and longevity. In Aim 2, a test breathalyzer was built that will utilize a nebulizer to generate virus laden air containing aerosol droplets similar to a breath that contain defined concentrations of CoV-2 viral particles. Aim 3 tested the airborne biosensor in a realistic environment. Co-I Chakrabarty's laboratory had unique capabilities of mimicking real-world environmental conditions, especially in the context of atmospheric aerosols, necessary for testing and optimizing the biosensor's performance for field deployment.

This project aimed to understand social and behavioral determinants of COVID-19 testing and variations within sub-groups of this population. In partnership with the largest federally qualified health center in the United States, a survey was administered and a randomized experiment was conducted on 2,160 individuals (540 families) to evaluate the effectiveness of risk-based messaging and incentives that promote repeated testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In a 2x2 (Messaging x Incentive) factorial experiment, participants were randomized to receive personalized messaging promoting repeated testing. Messaging focused upon either (1a) household risk or (1b) personal risk of COVID-19. They were also randomly assigned to an incentive condition that (2a) insures against losing baseline rewards for initial testing, or (2b) that enters them into a bonus lottery with a small chance to win $150 if they complete both tests. Both the insurance and lottery conditions carry the same incentive costs. Previous work in similar populations demonstrated that adherence to planned health behaviors is higher with insurance-based incentives than cash payments of equal value.

This included a longitudinal study to understand beliefs about and knowledge of COVID-19, and barriers and beliefs about testing and vaccination. Results informed a community-developed and based intervention to engage the cohort and other members of these populations in testing and vaccine education, and evaluated the impact of this intervention on testing and vaccination uptake in immigrant, low-income, and homeless communities. The Specific Aims were: (Aim 1) To understand patient perceptions of, fears about, and experiences with COVID-19 testing in immigrant, low-income, and homeless populations; (Aim 2a) To use the data from Aim 1 to develop and pilot test public health messaging in these immigrant, low-income, and homeless populations, and to develop a strategy for a testing program; (Aim 2b) To use the data from Aims 1 and 2a to develop, pilot test, and implement a walk-up, COVID-19 testing program to increase testing uptake in these immigrant, low-income, and homeless populations; and (Aim 3) To evaluate the impact of a public health messaging and testing program developed in Aim 2b on rapid COVID-19 testing uptake.",2023

These same communities are being ravaged by COVID-19, which is caused by infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. With California becoming one of the global pandemic epicenters in the US, coupled with the growing need for rapid COVID-19 testing, SRC partnered with expertise at UC San Diego to develop simple, rapid and inexpensive FDA-authorized COVID-19 testing that were offered using community-driven, contextually relevant strategies to accelerate broad testing uptake among underserved communities in San Diego. While all areas of San Diego County are seeing rising cases of COVID-19 infections, southern San Diego communities along the US-Mexico border, including Chula Vista, Otay Mesa and San Ysidro, are experiencing disproportionate increases in infections. Among these communities, San Ysidro stands out for several reasons. First, it represents one of the poorest communities in San Diego, a condition that drives health disparities. Second, San Ysidro has the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases in San Diego County, even with current (inadequate) levels of testing. Third, San Ysidro is located a significant distance from the major health centers in San Diego, such as UC San Diego Health, and access to adequate testing is problematic.

These and other social, cultural, and behavioral factors pose significant obstacles to public health efforts to increase population testing and vaccination in a pandemic. Testing and vaccination efforts must be paired with an understanding of the needs and cultures of different communities, and the contexts in which people live must be considered, especially among groups hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study approach was built on strong evidence from the team's decades-long program of health communication research to eliminate disparities, especially proven message tactics such as cultural values, disparity framing, and narratives, that was applied to the COVID-19 context. Specifically, a multi-method content analysis of 43,000+ COVID-19 testing inquiries to 2-1-1 callers was conducted with the following aims: Aim 1) Survey and interview over 500 2-1-1 callers and phone operators; Aim 2) Develop and evaluate in randomized A-B testing new COVID-19 testing messages among 300 2-1-1 callers; and Aim 3) Taken together, these activities identified essential contexts and content for communicating about COVID-19 testing to vulnerable populations, and Aim 3 integrated this knowledge into proven message tactics and determined their impact on interest in, and intention to be tested, and other key outcomes. The existing partnership with 2-1-1 was central to this research. Of the 24 priority populations identified in the NOSI, 2-1-1s serve a higher proportion of callers from nearly every group compared to their proportion of the U.S. population, including 60-80% racial or ethnic minorities, 40-55% with household income below $10,000, and 1 in 4 who have not completed high school. During COVID-19, 2-1-1s in 36 states have fielded 964,286 COVID-19 requests. These first-hand accounts from underserved Americans concerned about, or affected by, COVID-19 must inform communication efforts, and the infrastructure of 2-1-1 was well suited to support rapid testing of promising approaches.",2022

Their health and disease profile is driven by enduring social conditions (e.g., scarcity of income, food insecurity, access to health services, housing, discrimination). These prevailing social conditions can also undermine WWUDs' ability to protect themselves from COVID-19 (e.g., washing hands, social distancing). Drug procurement and use, which are largely social processes, further challenge these self-protection measures. Testing and future vaccination is vital to reducing COVID-19 among this high-risk population, necessitating accessible testing schemes. Here, a mixed methods study was conducted that draws upon the Andersen Behavioral Model10 and is grounded in eco-social theory. Specifically, the Baltimore-based study aimed to: 1) explore predisposing social factors (e.g., housing, food security), individual-level factors (e.g., drug use, mental health), and beliefs (e.g., medical mistrust) that are facilitators and barriers of COVID-19 testing and perceived risks (e.g., income generation, violence) resulting from a diagnosis through in-depth interviews among WWUD (N=15) and a cultural domain analysis (N=45); 2) gain an understanding of the enabling community-level environment (e.g., medical and social service agencies that currently serve WWUD, existing city-wide COVID-19 testing sites) that could facilitate or hinder WWUDs' COVID-testing uptake through observations (N=8-10) and key informant interviews (N=10); and examine predisposing social factors, individual-level factors, and beliefs that are associated with COVID-19 testing and retesting among a cohort (N=250) of WWUD at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Optional testing offered at both study visits were a self-administered, rapid antigen test. The role of medical mistrust in shaping women's' use of healthcare services were examined, as well as experiences of stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings, particularly among Black participants. In Baltimore, this mistrust was particularly pronounced, with Johns Hopkins Hospital having a long history of mistrust in the Black community owing to experimentation and deception of research engagement. The study was guided by a community advisory board (CAB) who informed its design and implementation as well as engaged in disseminating the results at community meetings to inform COVID-testing scale up.",2022

While progress has been made on the development of methods and the interpretation of data, much remains to be improved for the technology to be used as a public health management tool. A major drawback in the current approaches are: 1) the lack of streamlined and consistent pre-analytical processing steps, 2) coverage across the relevant targets requires a high number of reactions (>20) from any single sample to provide quantitative information, and 3) a lack of vision of the development of a pathogen/marker panel, much like those used in clinical arenas, for interpretation of the data across different states, regions and nations. The goal of this project was to successfully navigate these three limitations toward development of an advanced digital array PCR system as part of the development of public health warning system that is not dependent on clinical testing and has the ability to rapidly address novel pathogen thrust in the future.",2022

To date, cases have exponentially increased partly due to the lifting of locked-down restriction by the PR government, limited COVID-19 testing, and contact tracing. Puerto Ricans living on the island are particularly vulnerable to the current overlapping of the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters (earthquake, hurricanes/storms). Limited access to molecular COVID-19 testing throughout PR has been a significant challenge. Without adequate testing, estimates for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection rates are limited and targeted prevention efforts (focused testing) may hinder. A group of epidemiologists led by Dr. Marzán (MPI) developed a web-based COVID-19 Epidemiologic Surveillance System (ESSS) in collaboration with the Puerto Rico Public Health Trust (PRPHT, community partner for this grant) with more than 46,000 surveys completed. The ESSS tool was an online geocoded survey that identified real-time data of COVID-19 signs and symptoms during the last 24 hours; and thus, prioritized communities for COVID-19 testing. Leveraging the current PHSU-PRI COVID-19 prevention efforts and the ESSS infrastructure, the research team tested the preliminary impact of an epidemic intelligence (EpI-Net) community-based intervention aimed at increasing COVID-19 testing uptake and prevention practices among socially vulnerable communities in PR. The working hypothesis was that the integration of lay community leaders, trained in the use of COVID-19 prevention technology tools (EpI-Net), resulted in increased COVID-19 testing uptake and prevention practices among the targeted socially and epidemiologically vulnerable communities in Puerto Rico. This highly innovative and impactful study shifted current COVID-19 prevention strategies by 1) establishing an epidemic intelligence infrastructure using a technology-based COVID-19 syndromic surveillance (ESSS) platform to identify in real time potential COVID-19 outbreaks and, thus, conduct targeted COVID-19 testing, 2) by implementing a population-based COVID-19 prevention intervention (EpI-Net) co-led by epidemiologists and lay community leaders trained as health promotors.",2023

Despite higher rates of COVID-19 in Black and Latinx individuals compared to White individuals, rates of testing in predominately non-White, low-income communities were significantly lower than in high-income areas. Strategies to increase COVID-19 testing rates in underserved populations were urgently needed. Self-testing, where individuals collect their own samples, was feasible for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Self-testing increased testing convenience and privacy and was effectively leveraged to expand testing for other infections, such as HIV, in key populations across a broad spectrum of contexts. However, self-testing may be limited to those with access to health services, without reaching individuals underserved by existing medical systems. One promising approach to increase test uptake was the secondary distribution of self-testing kits, where an individual distributes tests to contacts in their social network and encourages them to self-test. A significant advantage of a secondary distribution strategy was that by decentralizing a health care process, individuals were more likely to access services if delivered by social network peers, rather than health professionals. In addition, secondary distribution enhanced contact tracing efforts, as individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 could have distributed self-tests to close contacts to identify additional cases. Given high levels of COVID-19 misinformation, stigma, and medical mistrust among vulnerable populations, this peer-driven test distribution strategy holds significant promise in increasing the reach of COVID-19 testing among underserved populations.

Additionally, the study will use a mixed methods strategy to identify key social, ethical, economic, and behavioral barriers and facilitators to secondary distribution to inform its future modifications, implementation, and scale-up (Aim 3). This study will engage in the relationship with community partners to reach underserved individuals with housing instability, immigrants, and those with significant medical comorbidities including HIV, viral hepatitis, and substance use disorders, in order to increase COVID-19 test uptake in these populations.

In the U.S., vulnerable populations experience significant disparities in terms of both infection and mortality rates, especially in the State of Texas, where Hispanic, African American, and other groups have experienced substantial disparities in both incidence and mortality. For example, Hispanics comprise 29.4% of the state's population, but 40.1% of COVID-19 cases and 47.9% of confirmed fatalities. The communities prioritized in this study include populations with medical comorbidities and those experiencing homelessness, and underserved Hispanics and African Americans in three racially diverse regions: South Texas, Houston/Harris County, and Northeast Texas. All of these regions are experiencing crisis-level surges in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Testing disparities in Texas are evident, but understudied, and rapid deployment and evaluation of prevention, diagnostic, and mitigation strategies is imperative. Building on the partnerships and resources of the UTHealth Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), the goal of this study was to partner with community and stakeholder colleagues to identify dynamic disease hotspots and testing deserts in racially diverse neighborhoods of the target regions and to use that information to inform the rapid adaptation and deployment of multilevel level just-in-time adaptive intervention strategies to reach vulnerable populations. This study accomplished the following aims: 1) Identify disparities and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 testing and infections in three Texas regions by (i) estimating real-time testing availability and uptake patterns utilizing data from regional health departments and hospital records; (ii) estimating real-time disparities in incidence rate and positive test rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19, and (iii) identifying, characterizing and predicting dynamic disease hotspots and testing deserts in vulnerable communities utilizing spatial-temporal modeling approaches. 2) Use multilevel network modeling methods to examine the structural properties of interorganizational networks; and apply network optimization methods to identify influential organizations that can maximize system-level organizational performance to better coordinate local testing and service delivery needs. 3) Engage CCTS community networks to develop, implement and evaluate a targeted, adaptive multilevel intervention to increase reach, uptake, implementation, and sustainment of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics among priority vulnerable populations. This study evaluated the reach, effectiveness and implementation of the Community level Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (Community JITAIs) to increase SARs-CoV-2 testing and reduce infections in identified high risk priority neighborhoods, and conducted an embedded study to evaluate the use of community health worker-delivered SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. This work was continued in Phase II of the funding by examining the aims in light of the COVID-19 vaccine being available to the populations of interest.",2022

In the U.S., vulnerable populations experience significant disparities in terms of both infection and mortality rates, especially in the State of Texas, where Hispanic, African American, and other groups have experienced substantial disparities in both incidence and mortality. For example, Hispanics comprise 29.4% of the state's population, but 40.1% of COVID-19 cases and 47.9% of confirmed fatalities. The communities prioritized in this study include populations with medical comorbidities and those experiencing homelessness, and underserved Hispanics and African Americans in three racially diverse regions: South Texas, Houston/Harris County, and Northeast Texas. All of these regions are experiencing crisis-level surges in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Testing disparities in Texas are evident, but understudied, and rapid deployment and evaluation of prevention, diagnostic, and mitigation strategies is imperative. Building on the partnerships and resources of the UTHealth Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), the goal of this study was to partner with community and stakeholder colleagues to identify dynamic disease hotspots and testing deserts in racially diverse neighborhoods of the target regions and to use that information to inform the rapid adaptation and deployment of multilevel level just-in-time adaptive intervention strategies to reach vulnerable populations. This study accomplished the following aims: 1) Identify disparities and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 testing and infections in three Texas regions by (i) estimating real-time testing availability and uptake patterns utilizing data from regional health departments and hospital records; (ii) estimating real-time disparities in incidence rate and positive test rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19, and (iii) identifying, characterizing and predicting dynamic disease hotspots and testing deserts in vulnerable communities utilizing spatial-temporal modeling approaches. 2) Use multilevel network modeling methods to examine the structural properties of interorganizational networks; and apply network optimization methods to identify influential organizations that can maximize system-level organizational performance to better coordinate local testing and service delivery needs. 3) Engage CCTS community networks to develop, implement and evaluate a targeted, adaptive multilevel intervention to increase reach, uptake, implementation, and sustainment of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics among priority vulnerable populations. This study evaluated the reach, effectiveness and implementation of the Community level Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (Community JITAIs) to increase SARs-CoV-2 testing and reduce infections in identified high risk priority neighborhoods, and conducted an embedded study to evaluate the use of community health worker-delivered SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

The study leveraged existing infrastructures to expand testing uptake and analyzed (by PCR) viral load at infection onset/exposure and following onset/exposure to determine viral dynamics and identify individuals at early and late stages of infection. NIH PhenX self-report measures were used to test intervention effects on testing and retesting uptake, time-to-diagnosis, COVID-19 knowledge, healthcare access and seeking, disclosure, medical adherence, and practice of home self-isolation, quarantine, and other infection control behaviors. All data acquisition, collection and curation approaches were informed by the CDCC, including AboutML-informed consent approaches and with the other RADx-UP studies and relevant federal agencies. The central hypothesis of this study argued that a persuasive mHealth Suite of apps and videos (co-created with community members) combined with person-centered COVID-19 testing choices (remote at home nasal swab versus on-site nasal swab), will lead to higher COVID-19 testing uptake in 7000 adults and children living in the geographic catchment areas of the 14 Mile Square Health Center practice sites (as compared with baseline rates of testing uptake in the same geographic catchment area). This relationship was mediated by a number of social, economic, and behavioral determinants of health, including self-reported COVID-19-related knowledge, COVID-19 social capital, COVID-19 racial/ethnic bias and stigma, and COVID-19 preventative and risk behaviors. Analysis of mediators was limited to the adult sample. This was accomplished utilizing a repeated measure, pre-post-test mediational design. Interviews were conducted over the phone on Day 1 and Day 28 of a 28-day study period, to track outcomes. With improved access to testing and care, self-management strategies of COVID-19 and increased knowledge, a higher percentage of people living in underserved neighborhoods will have access to testing and necessary follow-up care and are expected to develop a stronger sense of empowerment over their own healthcare decisions related to COVID-19. Three groups were recruited to participate in this study. The first group was recruited from the 14 Mile Square Health Center (MSHC) practice sites. The second group was recruited through contact tracing of COVID-19 test positives from MSHC. The third group was recruited from the community through posted study ads and flyers online, which first contained the study contact number and eventually contained an invitation to find out about the study through the mobile health (mHealth) suite of apps and videos. In addition to nasal swab testing for COVID-19, participants had access to smartphone apps to track symptoms, improve knowledge of COVID-19, and learn self-management skills while at home. Participants who were not initially identified via a call or in-person visit to Mile Square Health Clinic were given the opportunity to partake in rapid, COVID-19 nasal swab self-collection at home. Research members shared the data collected from the biological specimens, interviews, and apps with the Illinois Department of Public Health. The final goal of this study was the prevention of COVID-19 transmission through increased COVID-19 literacy and empowerment, combined with early intervention via rapid diagnosis, contact tracing, and earlier access to treatment.",2021

As compared to immunological and genetic-based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), this study completed the following specific aims.
(1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. This study constructed 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that required only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices were upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, the study optimized and automated existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device could automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c).
(2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. This study recruited a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). This study conducted breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status.
(3) Validated the COVID-19 biomarkers using refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, this study recruited a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2. This study leveraged existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, this study had a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings.",2023

Most Latinos live in rural areas, work as migrant farmworkers and have higher rates of underlying medical conditions, limited access to health care, and live in circumstances that interfere with implementation of community mitigation measures, all potentially leading to increased risk of COVID-19 exposure, morbidity and mortality. The community partner, the Hispanic Services Council (HSC) trained local promotoras de salud (community health workers), and in the past two years has reached 5,900 underserved Latino immigrant families in SW Florida. Recently, HSC promotoras reached over 300 Latino families to ask about the impact of COVID-19 on their health and well-being. The study built on ongoing partnership (R34At010661-01) with HSC and the promotoras to collect data using mixed methods to assess healthcare, social, economic, and contextual factors that influence the ability and willingness to get tested for COVID-19 and/or vaccinated. The findings guided products, including community education and population-specific marketing strategies, to improve testing and vaccination uptake. In partnering with and sharing information with other NOSI recipients the study hoped to increase testing for COVID-19 across diverse communities in the USA and to inform targeted implementation of COVID-19 vaccines. AIM 1: To work with the community partner, HSC and promotoras to examine in southwest Florida rural Latino migrant and immigrant communities, the multilevel barriers that affect COVID-19 testing and vaccine uptake at individual, interpersonal, institutional (e.g., health care system) and community levels. Aim 1a. Qualitative focus groups (in 4 rural cities) will be facilitated by promotora partners using interview guides informed by an NIMHD framework and existing COVID-19 relevant measures. Aim 1b. Facilitators and barriers identified in Aim 1a and responses to questions that are adapted from existing questionnaires will be used to predict willingness for COVID-19 testing and vaccination (in n = 500 rural Latinos), as well as actual testing behavior. Exploratory moderators will be investigated. AIM 2: Determine strategies to address social determinants of health (SDOH) that present barriers to participation in testing, testing follow-up and vaccine uptake to inform development of intervention strategies to increase access to and acceptability of testing and vaccine behavior in rural Latino groups. Aim 2a. Based on Aim 1, community engagement strategies will be formulated to inform culturally sensitive implementation of testing and vaccines for Florida's rural Latino population. Products including education materials for improved COVID-19 health literacy and social marketing strategies will be developed. Aim 2b. Charlas (informal group conversations, n = 50) facilitated by promotoras will provide feedback on potential products. Findings will lead to further product refinement, which can then be implemented by HSC in the Latino communities they serve, while being evaluated for effectiveness by the research group.",2022

Furthermore, Latinx populations may face barriers in accessing SARS-CoV-2 tests, receiving test results, interpreting test results, and getting appropriate follow-up care. Improved understanding of the sources of health equity differences for Latinx populations can be used to better guide allocation of resources and provide essential data for provider organizations seeking to support those in the most need. Through this RADx-UP project, a statewide research and monitoring infrastructure was established in partnership with community clinics. This study developed community health teams (""Promotoras Teams"") with the largest Latinx community organization in Rhode Island to address identified barriers to COVID-19 testing through patient navigation, health literacy support, and follow-up care. The overall goals of this study were to improve testing uptake and the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes among Latinx populations. This study built on partnerships with community clinics that serve a high proportion of Latinx individuals (>50%) in Rhode Island. This study placed particular emphasis on disparities in care faced by Latinx populations and factors that have been identified as impacting health equity in Rhode Island (integrated healthcare, community resilience, physical environment, socioeconomics, and community trauma). The insights gained from the quantitative and qualitative approaches were used guide the implementation of community campaigns to improve testing among Latinx populations that are in identified locations with lower per capita testing than other parts of the state (""testing deserts""). This RADx-UP project utilized a unique approach and infrastructure to monitor SARS-CoV-2 testing rates, including the use of the statewide Health Information Exchange (HIE) in Rhode Island that connects data across primary care, urgent care, specialty care, and acute care clinical environments. The HIE contains clinical data for most people receiving care in Rhode Island including SARS-CoV-2 test results from major laboratories and other facilities (e.g., CVS MinuteClinic). These quantitative data were combined with qualitative data and organized according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research framework to guide the mixed-methods explanatory sequential design. The specific aims of this project were to: (1) Identify COVID-19 hotspots and testing deserts using a near-real time geographic information system monitoring system; (2) Determine community and provider barriers that impact access to SARS-CoV-2 testing; and, (3) Implement community-based approaches to improve SARS-CoV-2 testing.

This study rapidly identified infections and developed approaches for isolating and contact-tracing to stem virus spread. 2) Serological Testing: Serology established background immunity levels in students and staff, from infection or vaccination, and followed those who are antibody-positive longitudinally to quantify temporal decay of IgG and neutralizing antibody levels. This study examined whether protective immunity in children with IDD, a population with prevalent immunological dysfunction, wanes at an accelerated rate compared to the population-at-large; by doing so this study addressed an important knowledge gap, and provided key data to inform public health policy. 3) Modeling to Optimize Testing: This study used network models and agent based simulation models (or hybrid approaches) to guide testing strategies and interventions at MCC. Simulations were conducted interactively and iteratively, to assist in planning and implementation of testing procedures, exploring the dynamic interplay between school operations and personnel interactions, potential infection risks and disease dynamics (including variant strains), and implementation of control measures (e.g. quarantine, isolation, contact-tracing and vaccination rates). 4) Mobile Unit Testing: This study built on a successful mobile approach to delivering mobile dental care to the IDD students of MCC (the SMILEmobile), by staffing, equipping and deploying a customized, disability-enabled, mobile testing unit, which was used to directly deliver rapid flexible testing to MCC. 5) Overcoming Testing & Vaccine Anxiety/Hesitancy: The study conducted focus group interviews at MCC to identify key community concerns, myths and misconceptions about vaccination, and then built on success in reducing vaccine hesitancy among URMC staff, to create a multimodal educational campaign that addressed these concerns. Strategies included a speakers' bureau, group discussions, and ""table talk"" conversations, combined with innovative visual approaches that communicated complex information in a readily accessible manner (via graphic medicine) and that promoted vaccine uptake (via narrative portraits of trusted peers and coworkers who have chosen to be vaccinated). Finally, this study assessed the impact of this program by deploying a validated, electronic patient reported outcome scale (PROMIS-29) already in widespread use across the UR health system and at Rochesters East High School, to collect longitudinal data from staff, parents/guardians and children (by proxy reporting) across multiple health domains (including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and social functioning).

This study examined whether protective immunity in children with IDD, a population with prevalent immunological dysfunction, wanes at an accelerated rate compared to the population-at-large; by doing so this study addressed an important knowledge gap, and provided key data to inform public health policy. 3) Modeling to Optimize Testing: This study used network models and agent based simulation models (or hybrid approaches) to guide testing strategies and interventions at MCC. Simulations were conducted interactively and iteratively, to assist in planning and implementation of testing procedures, exploring the dynamic interplay between school operations and personnel interactions, potential infection risks and disease dynamics (including variant strains), and implementation of control measures (e.g. quarantine, isolation, contact-tracing and vaccination rates). 4) Mobile Unit Testing: This study built on a successful mobile approach to delivering mobile dental care to the IDD students of MCC (the SMILEmobile), by staffing, equipping and deploying a customized, disability-enabled, mobile testing unit, which was used to directly deliver rapid flexible testing to MCC. 5) Overcoming Testing & Vaccine Anxiety/Hesitancy: The study conducted focus group interviews at MCC to identify key community concerns, myths and misconceptions about vaccination, and then built on success in reducing vaccine hesitancy among URMC staff, to create a multimodal educational campaign that addressed these concerns. Strategies included a speakers' bureau, group discussions, and ""table talk"" conversations, combined with innovative visual approaches that communicated complex information in a readily accessible manner (via graphic medicine) and that promoted vaccine uptake (via narrative portraits of trusted peers and coworkers who have chosen to be vaccinated). Finally, this study assessed the impact of this program by deploying a validated, electronic patient reported outcome scale (PROMIS-29) already in widespread use across the UR health system and at Rochesters East High School, to collect longitudinal data from staff, parents/guardians and children (by proxy reporting) across multiple health domains (including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and social functioning).

This study rapidly identified infections and developed approaches for isolating and contact-tracing to stem virus spread. 2) Serological Testing: Serology established background immunity levels in students and staff, from infection or vaccination, and followed those who are antibody-positive longitudinally to quantify temporal decay of IgG and neutralizing antibody levels. This study examined whether protective immunity in children with IDD, a population with prevalent immunological dysfunction, wanes at an accelerated rate compared to the population-at-large; by doing so this study addressed an important knowledge gap, and provided key data to inform public health policy. 3) Modeling to Optimize Testing: This study used network models and agent based simulation models (or hybrid approaches) to guide testing strategies and interventions at MCC. Simulations were conducted interactively and iteratively, to assist in planning and implementation of testing procedures, exploring the dynamic interplay between school operations and personnel interactions, potential infection risks and disease dynamics (including variant strains), and implementation of control measures (e.g. quarantine, isolation, contact-tracing and vaccination rates). 4) Mobile Unit Testing: This study built on a successful mobile approach to delivering mobile dental care to the IDD students of MCC (the SMILEmobile), by staffing, equipping and deploying a customized, disability-enabled, mobile testing unit, which was used to directly deliver rapid flexible testing to MCC. 5) Overcoming Testing & Vaccine Anxiety/Hesitancy: The study conducted focus group interviews at MCC to identify key community concerns, myths and misconceptions about vaccination, and then built on success in reducing vaccine hesitancy among URMC staff, to create a multimodal educational campaign that addressed these concerns. Strategies included a speakers' bureau, group discussions, and ""table talk"" conversations, combined with innovative visual approaches that communicated complex information in a readily accessible manner (via graphic medicine) and that promoted vaccine uptake (via narrative portraits of trusted peers and coworkers who have chosen to be vaccinated).

Simulations were conducted interactively and iteratively, to assist in planning and implementation of testing procedures, exploring the dynamic interplay between school operations and personnel interactions, potential infection risks and disease dynamics (including variant strains), and implementation of control measures (e.g. quarantine, isolation, contact-tracing and vaccination rates). 4) Mobile Unit Testing: This study built on a successful mobile approach to delivering mobile dental care to the IDD students of MCC (the SMILEmobile), by staffing, equipping and deploying a customized, disability-enabled, mobile testing unit, which was used to directly deliver rapid flexible testing to MCC. 5) Overcoming Testing & Vaccine Anxiety/Hesitancy: The study conducted focus group interviews at MCC to identify key community concerns, myths and misconceptions about vaccination, and then built on success in reducing vaccine hesitancy among URMC staff, to create a multimodal educational campaign that addressed these concerns. Strategies included a speakers' bureau, group discussions, and ""table talk"" conversations, combined with innovative visual approaches that communicated complex information in a readily accessible manner (via graphic medicine) and that promoted vaccine uptake (via narrative portraits of trusted peers and coworkers who have chosen to be vaccinated). Finally, this study assessed the impact of this program by deploying a validated, electronic patient reported outcome scale (PROMIS-29) already in widespread use across the UR health system and at Rochesters East High School, to collect longitudinal data from staff, parents/guardians and children (by proxy reporting) across multiple health domains (including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and social functioning).

This study rapidly identified infections and developed approaches for isolating and contact-tracing to stem virus spread. 2) Serological Testing: Serology established background immunity levels in students and staff, from infection or vaccination, and followed those who are antibody-positive longitudinally to quantify temporal decay of IgG and neutralizing antibody levels. This study examined whether protective immunity in children with IDD, a population with prevalent immunological dysfunction, wanes at an accelerated rate compared to the population-at-large; by doing so this study addressed an important knowledge gap, and provided key data to inform public health policy. 3) Modeling to Optimize Testing: This study used network models and agent based simulation models (or hybrid approaches) to guide testing strategies and interventions at MCC. Simulations were conducted interactively and iteratively, to assist in planning and implementation of testing procedures, exploring the dynamic interplay between school operations and personnel interactions, potential infection risks and disease dynamics (including variant strains), and implementation of control measures (e.g. quarantine, isolation, contact-tracing and vaccination rates). 4) Mobile Unit Testing: This study built on a successful mobile approach to delivering mobile dental care to the IDD students of MCC (the SMILEmobile), by staffing, equipping and deploying a customized, disability-enabled, mobile testing unit, which was used to directly deliver rapid flexible testing to MCC. 5) Overcoming Testing & Vaccine Anxiety/Hesitancy: The study conducted focus group interviews at MCC to identify key community concerns, myths and misconceptions about vaccination, and then built on success in reducing vaccine hesitancy among URMC staff, to create a multimodal educational campaign that addressed these concerns. Strategies included a speakers' bureau, group discussions, and ""table talk"" conversations, combined with innovative visual approaches that communicated complex information in a readily accessible manner (via graphic medicine) and that promoted vaccine uptake (via narrative portraits of trusted peers and coworkers who have chosen to be vaccinated). Finally, this study assessed the impact of this program by deploying a validated, electronic patient reported outcome scale (PROMIS-29) already in widespread use across the UR health system and at Rochesters East High School, to collect longitudinal data from staff, parents/guardians and children (by proxy reporting) across multiple health domains (including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and social functioning).

This research helps address the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable minority populations and examined: (1) the barriers to testing and uptake of future vaccines, (2) effectiveness of community engagement to increase the uptake of COVID-19 testing in the underserved communities, (3) acceptability, sensitivity and specificity of using less invasive testing methods compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, and (4) assessment of barriers and potential strategies to engage community members and community organizations in COVID-19 testing and vaccine deployment. Community-engaged research studies (in collaboration with community-based partners) were conducted to: (a) determine barriers to testing, and uptake of future vaccines, including health literacy, stigma, drug use and financial burden associated with testing, follow-up care, feasibility of effective self-isolation if positive, and perceived effectiveness of testing and vaccination, (b) assessment of the acceptability of extensive community outreach and deployment of a mobile COVID-19 testing unit to geographical areas occupied by underserved and vulnerable populations in close proximity to a community partner, Borinquen Health Care Center (BHCC), and (c) compare the acceptability, sensitivity, and specificity of alternative approaches to obtain samples, including medically administered nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva. The goal was to improve understanding of COVID-19-related health disparities; enhance access, effectiveness, and implementation of COVID-19 testing in vulnerable and/or underserved populations; and to mobilize the community to develop culturally-appropriate strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic and increase acceptance of future vaccines. The potential for evidence-based approaches to address COVID-19 disparities was facilitated by community-based partners that have the resources to provide community engagement, follow-up care, and public health mitigation for cases who test positive; the PI who managed a CLIA-certified laboratory at the university and a research team experienced in recruiting and retaining >1,000 study participants from the same vulnerable and underserved populations.",2023

Death rates attributable to COVID-19 among minority populations are several folds higher than among predominantly White counties. South Florida and specifically Miami-Dade County is an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, where non-Hispanic Blacks and Latinos are overrepresented in COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths. Pervasive structural inequities and social determinants of health are the main cause of health disparities due to a complex interaction of multiple factors including individual and societal risk factors. Understanding the impacts of these factors on health and social consequences of the pandemic has broad policy implications, especially for the acceptance of testing and future vaccines. This research helps address the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable minority populations and examined: (1) the barriers to testing and uptake of future vaccines, (2) effectiveness of community engagement to increase the uptake of COVID-19 testing in the underserved communities, (3) acceptability, sensitivity and specificity of using less invasive testing methods compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, and (4) assessment of barriers and potential strategies to engage community members and community organizations in COVID-19 testing and vaccine deployment. Community-engaged research studies (in collaboration with community-based partners) were conducted to: (a) determine barriers to testing, and uptake of future vaccines, including health literacy, stigma, drug use and financial burden associated with testing, follow-up care, feasibility of effective self-isolation if positive, and perceived effectiveness of testing and vaccination, (b) assessment of the acceptability of extensive community outreach and deployment of a mobile COVID-19 testing unit to geographical areas occupied by underserved and vulnerable populations in close proximity to a community partner, Borinquen Health Care Center (BHCC), and (c) compare the acceptability, sensitivity, and specificity of alternative approaches to obtain samples, including medically administered nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva.

ISCCCE is a strong partnership with the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, in which the team co-designed studies to increase implementation of evidence-based practices focused on equity. Together, this study was extremely well-positioned to extend the community-engaged efforts to COVID-19 testing, and to build an infrastructure that would support future COVID-related mitigation and prevention efforts in the vulnerable communities that the community health centers (CHCs) serve. This project included 6 community health center- community partnerships in nine vulnerable communities that continue to be COVID hot spots. These communities collectively had 1.3 million residents. Partner CHCs focused on COVID-19 testing for diagnostic purposes in symptomatic individuals, with limited outreach testing in high-risk communities. This project expanded the scope of testing to include prospective surveillance activities using dedicated testing and outreach teams. Accelerated testing efforts focused on CHC patients and community members who had significant social and medical vulnerabilities to COVID, per the NOSI, including those living in congregate housing, people experiencing homelessness, those with substance use disorders, low wage essential workers, and those with limited English proficiency. The partnership was well-integrated into the State's testing and contact tracing strategy, and well-positioned to leverage those resources. The study drew on a strongly community-engaged, equity-focused approach to implementation, and on Mass League's extensive experience in HIV testing and contact tracing. This study used an interrupted time series design to evaluate the impact of the enhanced outreach efforts on testing rates overall and on priority populations in the context of different phases of re-opening and restrictions. This study also used an exploratory sequential mixed methods approach to conduct a series of community-engaged pilot studies to address key barriers to testing and different approaches to return of results. The Human Participant Research Unit, co-led by academic and community-based investigators, guided the partnership's work through an ethics and equity lens.

Children with IDD are vulnerable to the negative impact of school closure. School districts provide critical services beyond the education, including nutritional, social, therapy (physical, occupational, and speech-language) and healthcare services. Risks are heightened for children with IDD, as they are often unable to wear masks, practice social distancing and/or implement effective hand hygiene. Access to rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 testing is essential for children with IDD and school staff in order to safely return to school. Members of the research team developed an innovative, scalable, low-cost method for SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva samples. Investigators at the Washington University Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC@WUSTL), in collaboration with the University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute of Human Development and the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Maryland (which includes an IDDRC, the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities, and the Kennedy Krieger School Programs), were ideally positioned to determine the best implementation strategies to maximize use of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test for vulnerable children and school staff in a school setting. The IDDRC@WUSTL has a long-standing relationship with the Special School District (SSD) of St. Louis County, whose mission is to serve children with IDD, and the national network of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD). First, the study determined the most effective messaging and implementation strategies to maximize weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing in a school setting. In this adaptive clinical trial, 52,000 diagnostic tests were administered to students and school staff at SSD, whose student population is 48% Black. Second, the study measured national attitudes among parents/guardians of children with IDD and school staff regarding the impact of COVID-19 and the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing. At the successful completion of this project, this study improved the acceptance, adoption, and process for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing in a school-based setting to enable delivery of critical educational activities for children with IDD in an underserved community. By identifying the most effective methods for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a vulnerable population of children with IDD, the study established a blueprint for wider adoption of COVID-19 mitigation efforts, such as vaccination.",2022

Latinos make up ~14% of the Utah population vs. ~21% of Utah's COVID-19 cases (50% higher) and the case rate is over 3-fold higher in neighborhoods characterized by high vs. low deprivation. In the Utah 2020-2021 school year, there have been 36,484 school-associated cases of COVID-19. The ongoing partnerships with the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) allowed access to real-time information on ""hotspot schools"" across the state. One of the Utah school district partners, Granite School District (n=85 schools), had the 3rd highest number of cases of COVID-19 and 45% of its schools have a student population with >50% eligible to receive free/reduced lunch and 60% have a student population that is >50% ethnic minority. Schools bear a large part of the burden of managing COVID-19 testing and communicating with parents about testing their children. Few schools in Utah have information technology systems in place to support systematic communication with parents about student COVID-19 testing and tracking testing outcomes. Through the existing RADx-UP grant (UL1TR002538-03S4), the team developed a text messaging and health navigator infrastructure that was deployed in federally-qualified health centers across Utah. The study chose to use text messaging because it is widely available in underserved communities, with 97% of individuals with an annual income <$30,000 and 96% with educational attainment of high school or less having a phone that can text. This project addressed key testing challenges in schools by building on existing collaborations with school districts and with UDOH on COVID-19 testing and existing infrastructure. This study worked closely with schools and the Utah public health system to implement and test a shovel-ready and scalable health information technology approach that delivers automated text messages (TMs) to staff and students' parents around COVID-19 testing. In addition, students in some schools received a health navigator (HN) follow-up to ensure that tests are completed. HN were community members who have been trained in case management. Families were offered the recently FDA-approved in-home serial testing approach if accessing in-person testing was a challenge. Within the context of a cluster-randomized trial, this study employed a rapid cycle design to test interventions on a small scale, using short time frames (<1month) and iterative evaluation cycles. This approach was extremely successful in the current RADx-UP project, SCALE-UP Utah. The proposed trial compared the efficacy of TM versus TM+HN. This project had several potential impacts on COVID-19 testing for elementary and middle school students in disadvantaged school settings: 1] SCALE-UP Counts provided critical data on the impact of pragmatic and scalable approaches to increasing COVID-19 testing and reducing COVID-19-related health inequities among students and their families. 2] The rapid cycle research approach utilized in this project allowed the team to quickly disseminate effective interventions to other schools and adapt interventions to changing testing policies and local outbreaks and rates. 3] The use of HNs who are members of the students' communities maximized the team's ability to integrate communities' cultural factors and strengths and to promote the acceptability of the testing support provided. 4] SCALE-UP Counts hold a significant impact on community transmission of COVID-19 due to the provision of testing to students' immediate household members. Rates of household transmission were 50-75% and thus, ensuring testing for households is essential towards decreasing community spread. 5] The interventions were made readily available for adoption by other disadvantaged school settings and the data will advance population health and implementation science.",2023

Latinos make up ~14% of the Utah population vs. ~21% of Utah's COVID-19 cases (50% higher) and the case rate is over 3-fold higher in neighborhoods characterized by high vs. low deprivation. In the Utah 2020-2021 school year, there have been 36,484 school-associated cases of COVID-19. The ongoing partnerships with the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) allowed access to real-time information on ""hotspot schools"" across the state. One of the Utah school district partners, Granite School District (n=85 schools), had the 3rd highest number of cases of COVID-19 and 45% of its schools have a student population with >50% eligible to receive free/reduced lunch and 60% have a student population that is >50% ethnic minority. Schools bear a large part of the burden of managing COVID-19 testing and communicating with parents about testing their children. Few schools in Utah have information technology systems in place to support systematic communication with parents about student COVID-19 testing and tracking testing outcomes. Through the existing RADx-UP grant (UL1TR002538-03S4), the team developed a text messaging and health navigator infrastructure that was deployed in federally-qualified health centers across Utah. The study chose to use text messaging because it is widely available in underserved communities, with 97% of individuals with an annual income <$30,000 and 96% with educational attainment of high school or less having a phone that can text. This project addressed key testing challenges in schools by building on existing collaborations with school districts and with UDOH on COVID-19 testing and existing infrastructure. This study worked closely with schools and the Utah public health system to implement and test a shovel-ready and scalable health information technology approach that delivers automated text messages (TMs) to staff and students' parents around COVID-19 testing. In addition, students in some schools received a health navigator (HN) follow-up to ensure that tests are completed. HN were community members who have been trained in case management. Families were offered the recently FDA-approved in-home serial testing approach if accessing in-person testing was a challenge. Within the context of a cluster-randomized trial, this study employed a rapid cycle design to test interventions on a small scale, using short time frames (<1month) and iterative evaluation cycles. This approach was extremely successful in the current RADx-UP project, SCALE-UP Utah. The proposed trial compared the efficacy of TM versus TM+HN. This project had several potential impacts on COVID-19 testing for elementary and middle school students in disadvantaged school settings: 1] SCALE-UP Counts provided critical data on the impact of pragmatic and scalable approaches to increasing COVID-19 testing and reducing COVID-19-related health inequities among students and their families. 2] The rapid cycle research approach utilized in this project allowed the team to quickly disseminate effective interventions to other schools and adapt interventions to changing testing policies and local outbreaks and rates. 3] The use of HNs who are members of the students' communities maximized the team's ability to integrate communities' cultural factors and strengths and to promote the acceptability of the testing support provided. 4] SCALE-UP Counts hold a significant impact on community transmission of COVID-19 due to the provision of testing to students' immediate household members. Rates of household transmission were 50-75% and thus, ensuring testing for households is essential towards decreasing community spread. 5] The interventions were made readily available for adoption by other disadvantaged school settings and the data will advance population health and implementation science.",2023

This implementation study assessed the modality and venue preferences for COVID 19 testing in rural, incarcerated, and other underserved populations in the state of Alabama. The objective of the study was to evaluate the implementation of a rapid scale-up SARS CoV-2 testing strategy. The original goal of the study was to conduct 30,000 tests in rural counties statewide. In Aim 1, the study defined higher case burden as counties with more than 25 daily cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 total population and lower case burden as less than 10 daily cases per 100,000, both using a 7-day average. In order to identify communities particularly vulnerable to morbidity and disease spread, age, race, income and education were mapped based on census data; and the COVID vulnerability index which included social determinants of health as well as data regarding healthcare access, and COVID-19 disease risk factors. The study also mapped areas where mitigation efforts are particularly poor via cell phone movement and a surrogate measure of belief in COVID-19 science and public policy recommendations. These data were used to work with community partners to prioritize rural counties for testing delivery. All analyses used publicly available aggregate data and did not enroll individuals. As such, these Aim 1 data were not transmitted to the CDCC. For Aim 2, the study partnered with a third-party survey vendor to collect the full battery of Tier 1 Common Data Elements (CDEs) required for the project. The survey sample (n~300) was a representative sample of the rural populations from various counties in which the tests were administered. This data was uploaded to the CDCC including all required CDEs. For Aim 3, in collaboration with community partners, specifically the Alabama Area Health Education Centers (AHEC), the study administered COVID-19 tests within underserved rural populations statewide. All told from 10/01/20 until 02/28/22, the study administered over 23,000 PCR tests, which resulted in a 12% positivity rate. This included testing with the Visby point-of-care PCR test developed via RADx-TECH, which had particular uptake in rural jails across Alabama. In accordance with DHHS reporting requirements, this study collected basic demographic data from all those who were tested, including race, gender, and age. As approved by NIH, this limited dataset was provided for all persons tested via this project, but not all CDEs, as testing was done as standard of care and not for research purposes. Aim 4 of the study evaluated the effectiveness of the testing initiative’s implementation strategy, which was completed by June 2022. This study wanted to know how appropriate and feasible the testing initiative has been for those involved. The target population for this aim of the study were researchers, administrators, and testing staff who have been involved in the project, and did not include the general population and communities offered testing services. As such, there was no individual-level data capture aligned with the CDCC CDE model. This study collected over 100 surveys and conducted 50 in-depth interviews for this aim.",2022

The 1-year project implemented and evaluated a brief Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention through the Albany Area Primary Health Care, a rural Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). The primary goal of this study was to maximize effective outreach, education, and communication through CHWs in order to facilitate improved COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake in underserved and vulnerable communities. CHWs were deployed to the homes of adults with increased risk of morbidity and mortality (i.e., African Americans or Latinos with uncontrolled diabetes or prediabetes, age <50 years, and non-COVID-19 vaccinated) in order to educate them about diabetes, COVID-19 and related vaccines. Health assessments, including blood glucose measurement, were conducted on the indexed patient and offered to all other adult family members in the household (i.e., ""bubble""). Adults with Type 2 diabetes likely live in households with other adults who have or are at increased risk for diabetes (i.e., prediabetes and obesity). It was expected that they would also share similar COVID-19 exposure risk. The specific aims were to: 1) Evaluate a community-driven education program to increase and enhance COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes and their families (i.e., their ""bubble"") and 2) Evaluate a community-driven education program to improve diabetes self-management behaviors and related outcomes (e.g., blood glucose) in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes in rural, Southwest Georgia.",2022

The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted the African American across the United States. Louisiana ranked 1st in the nation in per capita incidence of COVID-19. African Americans make up over 50% of the deaths of all known COVID-19 patients in the state, while only representing about 32% of the population. With the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, an urgent assessment of the African American community's readiness for vaccine uptake was needed to inform a pharmacist-led intervention model that would increase vaccine uptake. The Specific Aims of this proposal were: Specific Aim #1: To identify factors of vaccine hesitancy and the potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among the adult African-American community in Southeastern Louisiana. Specific Aim #2: To assess the personal and financial impact of COVID-19, knowledge of COVID-19, as well as experience with the healthcare system with regards to COVID-19. Specific Aim #3: To use the results of Aim #1 and #2 to inform a community pharmacist certification course and a pharmacist led intervention model among pharmacist vaccinators. Method: Specific Aim #1 and #2 were assessed by a survey at the start of study with an abbreviated follow-up survey 9 months later from clinic, community member and community pharmacy patient respondents. Changes in vaccine hesitancy and the impact on vaccine uptake were determined. Aim #3 was assessed by a pharmacist led education intervention model with vaccine uptake surveillance in community pharmacies across Louisiana to assess COVID-19 and other ACIP eligible vaccines. Impact: The implications of this project were to understand health related beliefs and behaviors related to COVID-19 and vaccination and their impact on the likely uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine among African Americans. It also provided data to facilitate the development of strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccination in a vulnerable community with community pharmacists as vaccinators and with a pre-and post analysis plan to assess the intervention’s success. This grant also facilitated training early stage investigators and diversified the health research workforce as the majority of researchers are among underrepresented minorities and/or women.",2022

With the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, an urgent assessment of the African American community's readiness for vaccine uptake was needed to inform a pharmacist-led intervention model that would increase vaccine uptake. The Specific Aims of this proposal were: Specific Aim #1: To identify factors of vaccine hesitancy and the potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among the adult African-American community in Southeastern Louisiana. Specific Aim #2: To assess the personal and financial impact of COVID-19, knowledge of COVID-19, as well as experience with the healthcare system with regards to COVID-19. Specific Aim #3: To use the results of Aim #1 and #2 to inform a community pharmacist certification course and a pharmacist led intervention model among pharmacist vaccinators. Method: Specific Aim #1 and #2 were assessed by a survey at the start of study with an abbreviated follow-up survey 9 months later from clinic, community member and community pharmacy patient respondents. Changes in vaccine hesitancy and the impact on vaccine uptake were determined. Aim #3 was assessed by a pharmacist led education intervention model with vaccine uptake surveillance in community pharmacies across Louisiana to assess COVID-19 and other ACIP eligible vaccines. Impact: The implications of this project were to understand health related beliefs and behaviors related to COVID-19 and vaccination and their impact on the likely uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine among African Americans. It also provided data to facilitate the development of strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccination in a vulnerable community with community pharmacists as vaccinators and with a pre-and post analysis plan to assess the intervention’s success. This grant also facilitated training early stage investigators and diversified the health research workforce as the majority of researchers are among underrepresented minorities and/or women.",2022

The objectives of this study were to: (a) evaluate the full impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy to inform testing strategies, (b) examine the factors that impede testing during pregnancy, and (c) use study data to devise implementation strategies that improve SARS-CoV-2 testing in pregnancy and prenatal care during the pandemic. To do so, this study proposed to prospectively enroll two cohorts of pregnant women: 1) exposed (SARS-CoV-2 positive), and 2) unexposed (SARS-CoV-2 negative as defined by antibody testing at the beginning of pregnancy, every trimester, and at delivery). Women who initially enroll as unexposed but later test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies crossed over to the exposed cohort. In total, an estimated 179 pregnant women were followed per cohort. In Aim 1, the study evaluated patients' and providers' perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 testing during pregnancy and the influence of COVID-19 on maternal care-seeking behavior and anxiety via surveys and semi-structured interviews. The study hypothesized suboptimal uptake of testing among pregnant women due to the fear of repercussions from a positive test. In Aim 2, the study determined the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on the risk of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes in symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. The study hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection will increase the risk of preterm birth by 12%, regardless of disease severity. In Aim 3, the study estimated the risk of mother-to-fetus SARS-CoV-2 transmission and viral presence in umbilical cord blood, placenta, and amniotic fluid by assaying for viral RNA in the neonate, cord blood, and placenta. The study hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother to fetus. Collectively, Aims 1-3 were interpreted by investigators, a Scientific Advisory Board (experts in obstetrics, infectious disease, implementation science, disparities) and Community Advisory Board (an obstetric social worker, pregnant women, and a director of a community obstetrics clinic) who applied data to devising targeted implementation strategies designed for rapid community dissemination to improve testing and prenatal care. In sum, this study filled knowledge gaps on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and current utilization of diagnostic testing in pregnancy. Further, it created implementation strategies to overcome barriers to testing, increase uptake, and promote acceptance and sustainability of testing. Lastly, this study helped determine optimal testing strategies by examining the necessity of testing for asymptomatic disease, informed prenatal care plans by assessing the full impact of infection, and contributed to the ability to counsel women and create prenatal care plans if they are pregnant or considering pregnancy.",2023

The objectives of this study were to: (a) evaluate the full impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy to inform testing strategies, (b) examine the factors that impede testing during pregnancy, and (c) use study data to devise implementation strategies that improve SARS-CoV-2 testing in pregnancy and prenatal care during the pandemic. To do so, this study proposed to prospectively enroll two cohorts of pregnant women: 1) exposed (SARS-CoV-2 positive), and 2) unexposed (SARS-CoV-2 negative as defined by antibody testing at the beginning of pregnancy, every trimester, and at delivery). Women who initially enroll as unexposed but later test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies crossed over to the exposed cohort. In total, an estimated 179 pregnant women were followed per cohort. In Aim 1, the study evaluated patients' and providers' perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 testing during pregnancy and the influence of COVID-19 on maternal care-seeking behavior and anxiety via surveys and semi-structured interviews. The study hypothesized suboptimal uptake of testing among pregnant women due to the fear of repercussions from a positive test. In Aim 2, the study determined the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on the risk of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes in symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. The study hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection will increase the risk of preterm birth by 12%, regardless of disease severity. In Aim 3, the study estimated the risk of mother-to-fetus SARS-CoV-2 transmission and viral presence in umbilical cord blood, placenta, and amniotic fluid by assaying for viral RNA in the neonate, cord blood, and placenta. The study hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother to fetus. Collectively, Aims 1-3 were interpreted by investigators, a Scientific Advisory Board (experts in obstetrics, infectious disease, implementation science, disparities) and Community Advisory Board (an obstetric social worker, pregnant women, and a director of a community obstetrics clinic) who applied data to devising targeted implementation strategies designed for rapid community dissemination to improve testing and prenatal care. In sum, this study filled knowledge gaps on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and current utilization of diagnostic testing in pregnancy.

Neighborhood-level disparities in cases and deaths in NYC can be explained by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic characteristics, where Latinx and Black New Yorkers and those living in high poverty neighborhoods are 1.5 times more likely to test positive and more than twice as likely to die as a result of COVID-19. The community of Mott Haven is located in the South Bronx - the poorest congressional district within the continental United States. Mott Haven is highly diverse (73% are Latinx and 24% are Black), and COVID-19 mortality was onceamong the highest NYC and higher than in NYC as a whole - an epicenter within an epicenter. Yet, although Mott Haven is clearly a priority community for COVID-related prevention, detection, vaccination, and treatment initiatives, fewer than 2% of residents had been tested at the time of study. COVID-19 secondary attack rates are highest in households, varying between 12-38%. This project involved a COVID-19 testing and mitigation intervention in public housing households in Mott Haven, which are characterized by crowding, intergenerational co-residence, and a high proportion of low wage ""essential workers"" who leave the home for work even during lockdown periods. This project evaluated the effectiveness of an innovative Nurse-Community Health Worker (CHW)-Family Partnership intervention designed to promote COVID-19 testing uptake, adoption of COVID-19 control measures, and mutual aid capacity at the household level. The intervention was adapted from the Nurse-Family Partnership model, which has been shown to be effective and cost-effective in improving maternal and child health outcomes in high-poverty, racially- and ethnically-diverse communities. CHWs provided culturally-appropriate support to families, addressing stigma, medical mistrust, and other common barriers to engagement in healthcare. A 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted, in which 270 households (810 individuals) were randomly assigned (2:1) to either the experimental group of families who received the Nurse-CHW-Family Partnership intervention and the offer of in-home testing, or the treatment-as-usual control group referred to free testing located within walking distance. Participants in both arms were assessed at baseline and monthly for 9 months. The findings from this study provided an evidence-base to inform current and future public health initiatives related to COVID-19 mitigation in other high-risk settings. Sustainability was addressed by building local capacity and expertise among participants, CHWs and CAB members, and partnering with them to develop the community's best practices for COVID-19. This intervention can be tailored to increase testing and other COVID-19 control measures in other settings of vulnerability and disadvantage.",2021

Children with IDD are vulnerable to the negative impact of school closure. School districts provide critical services beyond the education, including nutritional, social, therapy (physical, occupational, and speech-language) and healthcare services. Risks are heightened for children with IDD, as they are often unable to wear masks, practice social distancing and/or implement effective hand hygiene. Access to rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 testing is essential for children with IDD and school staff in order to safely return to school. Members of the research team developed an innovative, scalable, low-cost method for SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva samples. Investigators at the Washington University Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC@WUSTL), in collaboration with the University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute of Human Development and the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Maryland (which includes an IDDRC, the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities, and the Kennedy Krieger School Programs), were ideally positioned to determine the best implementation strategies to maximize use of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test for vulnerable children and school staff in a school setting. The IDDRC@WUSTL has a long-standing relationship with the Special School District (SSD) of St. Louis County, whose mission is to serve children with IDD, and the national network of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD). First, the study determined the most effective messaging and implementation strategies to maximize weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing in a school setting. In this adaptive clinical trial, 52,000 diagnostic tests were administered to students and school staff at SSD, whose student population is 48% Black. Second, the study measured national attitudes among parents/guardians of children with IDD and school staff regarding the impact of COVID-19 and the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Children with IDD are vulnerable to the negative impact of school closure. School districts provide critical services beyond the education, including nutritional, social, therapy (physical, occupational, and speech-language) and healthcare services. Risks are heightened for children with IDD, as they are often unable to wear masks, practice social distancing and/or implement effective hand hygiene. Access to rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 testing is essential for children with IDD and school staff in order to safely return to school. Members of the research team developed an innovative, scalable, low-cost method for SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva samples. Investigators at the Washington University Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC@WUSTL), in collaboration with the University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute of Human Development and the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Maryland (which includes an IDDRC, the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities, and the Kennedy Krieger School Programs), were ideally positioned to determine the best implementation strategies to maximize use of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test for vulnerable children and school staff in a school setting. The IDDRC@WUSTL has a long-standing relationship with the Special School District (SSD) of St. Louis County, whose mission is to serve children with IDD, and the national network of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD). First, the study determined the most effective messaging and implementation strategies to maximize weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing in a school setting. In this adaptive clinical trial, 52,000 diagnostic tests were administered to students and school staff at SSD, whose student population is 48% Black. Second, the study measured national attitudes among parents/guardians of children with IDD and school staff regarding the impact of COVID-19 and the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Children with IDD are vulnerable to the negative impact of school closure. School districts provide critical services beyond the education, including nutritional, social, therapy (physical, occupational, and speech-language) and healthcare services. Risks are heightened for children with IDD, as they are often unable to wear masks, practice social distancing and/or implement effective hand hygiene. Access to rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 testing is essential for children with IDD and school staff in order to safely return to school. Members of the research team developed an innovative, scalable, low-cost method for SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva samples. Investigators at the Washington University Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC@WUSTL), in collaboration with the University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute of Human Development and the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Maryland (which includes an IDDRC, the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities, and the Kennedy Krieger School Programs), were ideally positioned to determine the best implementation strategies to maximize use of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test for vulnerable children and school staff in a school setting. The IDDRC@WUSTL has a long-standing relationship with the Special School District (SSD) of St. Louis County, whose mission is to serve children with IDD, and the national network of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD). First, the study determined the most effective messaging and implementation strategies to maximize weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing in a school setting. In this adaptive clinical trial, 52,000 diagnostic tests were administered to students and school staff at SSD, whose student population is 48% Black.

Children with IDD are vulnerable to the negative impact of school closure. School districts provide critical services beyond the education, including nutritional, social, therapy (physical, occupational, and speech-language) and healthcare services. Risks are heightened for children with IDD, as they are often unable to wear masks, practice social distancing and/or implement effective hand hygiene. Access to rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 testing is essential for children with IDD and school staff in order to safely return to school. Members of the research team developed an innovative, scalable, low-cost method for SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva samples. Investigators at the Washington University Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC@WUSTL), in collaboration with the University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute of Human Development and the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Maryland (which includes an IDDRC, the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities, and the Kennedy Krieger School Programs), were ideally positioned to determine the best implementation strategies to maximize use of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test for vulnerable children and school staff in a school setting. The IDDRC@WUSTL has a long-standing relationship with the Special School District (SSD) of St. Louis County, whose mission is to serve children with IDD, and the national network of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD). First, the study determined the most effective messaging and implementation strategies to maximize weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing in a school setting. In this adaptive clinical trial, 52,000 diagnostic tests were administered to students and school staff at SSD, whose student population is 48% Black. Second, the study measured national attitudes among parents/guardians of children with IDD and school staff regarding the impact of COVID-19 and the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Children with IDD are vulnerable to the negative impact of school closure. School districts provide critical services beyond the education, including nutritional, social, therapy (physical, occupational, and speech-language) and healthcare services. Risks are heightened for children with IDD, as they are often unable to wear masks, practice social distancing and/or implement effective hand hygiene. Access to rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 testing is essential for children with IDD and school staff in order to safely return to school. Members of the research team developed an innovative, scalable, low-cost method for SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva samples. Investigators at the Washington University Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC@WUSTL), in collaboration with the University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute of Human Development and the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Maryland (which includes an IDDRC, the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities, and the Kennedy Krieger School Programs), were ideally positioned to determine the best implementation strategies to maximize use of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test for vulnerable children and school staff in a school setting. The IDDRC@WUSTL has a long-standing relationship with the Special School District (SSD) of St. Louis County, whose mission is to serve children with IDD, and the national network of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD). First, the study determined the most effective messaging and implementation strategies to maximize weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing in a school setting. In this adaptive clinical trial, 52,000 diagnostic tests were administered to students and school staff at SSD, whose student population is 48% Black.

In 2020 alone, it will cost a million lives. It continues to wreak economic havoc worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to develop new tools that can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV- 2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Rapid screening tools can identify potentially infected individuals who can then be isolated/quarantined from the uninfected and directed towards further testing and treatment. Unfortunately, definitive viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 has proven difficult to implement in many countries, including the US, due to technical, financial and governmental hurdles to universal access and timely processing. Symptom-based screening offers a valuable, albeit imperfect, complement to viral testing that can help identify many individuals with the disease for isolation as well as treatment. A major challenge with symptomatic testing is that COVID-19 is highly protean: the heterogeneity of symptoms means no single symptom or constellation of symptoms is definitive diagnostically. Still, there is growing evidence that sudden partial or complete olfactory loss, even more than other symptoms such as fever or dry cough, is the single best predictor of COVID-19. In this project, objective, self-administered smell tests were developed and implemented for the purpose of identifying individuals with COVID-19 prior to, or in the absence of, viral testing, as well as for use in population-level surveillance of COVID-19 spread. Several kinds of objective tests were used in clinical or laboratory settings to assess an individual's olfactory ability, including those that test the ability to identify or discriminate odors as well as procedures to determine the lowest concentration an individual can reliably perceive (i.e., odor detection threshold). Each approach had technical and logistical advantages and disadvantages, and each captured different aspects of olfactory dysfunction. Regarding COVID-19, it is unknown what type of measure had the highest specificity or sensitivity. Aim 1 relied on the use of self-administered objective testing of odor identification and odor detection threshold in SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals to determine which olfactory measure was the best predictor of COVID-19. Aim 2 used objective smell testing to assess whether population monitoring of olfactory loss in university, municipal or other community settings can serve as a sentinel of COVID-19 community spread. Together, these studies provided a rapid, remote-friendly, cost-effective, scalable, non-intrusive method to screen for COVID-19 at the individual level and to assess prevalence in communities, especially those that have been traditionally underserved by the health care system and public health infrastructure.",2023

Several kinds of objective tests were used in clinical or laboratory settings to assess an individual's olfactory ability, including those that test the ability to identify or discriminate odors as well as procedures to determine the lowest concentration an individual can reliably perceive (i.e., odor detection threshold). Each approach had technical and logistical advantages and disadvantages, and each captured different aspects of olfactory dysfunction. Regarding COVID-19, it is unknown what type of measure had the highest specificity or sensitivity. Aim 1 relied on the use of self-administered objective testing of odor identification and odor detection threshold in SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals to determine which olfactory measure was the best predictor of COVID-19. Aim 2 used objective smell testing to assess whether population monitoring of olfactory loss in university, municipal or other community settings can serve as a sentinel of COVID-19 community spread. Together, these studies provided a rapid, remote-friendly, cost-effective, scalable, non-intrusive method to screen for COVID-19 at the individual level and to assess prevalence in communities, especially those that have been traditionally underserved by the health care system and public health infrastructure.",2022

In 2020 alone, it will cost a million lives. It continues to wreak economic havoc worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to develop new tools that can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV- 2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Rapid screening tools can identify potentially infected individuals who can then be isolated/quarantined from the uninfected and directed towards further testing and treatment. Unfortunately, definitive viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 has proven difficult to implement in many countries, including the US, due to technical, financial and governmental hurdles to universal access and timely processing. Symptom-based screening offers a valuable, albeit imperfect, complement to viral testing that can help identify many individuals with the disease for isolation as well as treatment. A major challenge with symptomatic testing is that COVID-19 is highly protean: the heterogeneity of symptoms means no single symptom or constellation of symptoms is definitive diagnostically. Still, there is growing evidence that sudden partial or complete olfactory loss, even more than other symptoms such as fever or dry cough, is the single best predictor of COVID-19. In this project, objective, self-administered smell tests were developed and implemented for the purpose of identifying individuals with COVID-19 prior to, or in the absence of, viral testing, as well as for use in population-level surveillance of COVID-19 spread.

In historically marginalized communities they are trusted providers for a range of support services for families in need. The tradeoff between these crucial benefits of in-person learning against the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in school settings has been hotly debated throughout much of 2020 and 2021. The stakes are particularly high in historically marginalized communities which rely most heavily on school services, but have also been hit the hardest by COVID-19 primarily due to structural issues. The Safer at School Early Alert (SASEA) program was co-developed by the University of California, San Diego, the County of San Diego, and 15 partner schools serving socially vulnerable students in 5 school districts across San Diego County. SASEA utilized daily wastewater and surface (floor) environmental monitoring to detect asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among students and staff on campus. Positive environmental signals were immediately followed by targeted responsive testing for a whole school (in the case of wastewater) or classroom (for a positive surface sample). This project developed the Safer at School Early Alert School-Neighborhood Asset Portal (SASEA- SNAP), an online school environmental monitoring report dashboard with resources to address structural barriers to COVID-19 diagnostic testing in historically marginalized communities (Aim 1). This study also created a toolkit to allow any school to rapidly adapt the template to their specific setting. In Aims 2 and 3, the study used a randomized stepped wedge trial to compare SASEA (control) vs SASEA-SNAP (intervention) in 50 schools across 4 diverse school clusters in San Diego County. The primary outcome (Aim 2) was higher rates of diagnostic testing in intervention schools. The secondary outcome (Aim 3) was increased risk mitigation behaviors in school community members when environmental surveillance data suggested a potential case on campus. In Aim 4, the study used parent-child narrative interviews with 40 parent-student pairs to understand how children perceive COVID-19 risk at school, assess differences in perceptions of testing barriers between intervention and control sites, and better understand how children understand the process of environmental surveillance and responsive testing.",2022

Central to the state's extreme vulnerability is higher prevalence of medical comorbidities, lower access to care among rural populations, and decreased vaccine uptake compared to urban counterparts. Of considerable concern, testing has decreased statewide to allow for active dispersal of the vaccines. Unfortunately, low testing compounds vulnerability to COVID-19 in medically underserved populations where vaccine uptake is low, as they are extremely susceptible to persistent localized outbreaks of the virus and subsequently higher morbidity and mortality. The RADx-UP Phase Two proposal built upon previously funded RADx-UP Phase One by identifying and targeting vaccine desert communities then tailoring testing event services to the needs of individual communities building upon their perceptions of what is important. Providing a dynamic solution for continued testing is critical. This study defined vaccine deserts using overall vaccination rate and the change in vaccine uptake over a two-week period. Machine learning with time series modeling was used to characterize county level transmissibility, incorporating here for the first-time vaccination rates. Risk estimates at the county level were overlaid with zip codes where vaccine deserts have been identified using bottom decile for overall vaccination rate and change in vaccination over a 14-day period. Once a community was identified, study liaisons connected study staff to advocates to conduct semi-structured interviews to identify partner sites to host testing events and collect data to tailor promotions, food, and media messaging to the specific needs of each community targeted. Testing events involved sample and survey data collection, with promotions and chance giveaways to incentivize communities to participate. The study built upon RADx-UP one activity by focusing heavily on first responders in each community to aid in hosting testing events, and faith based and on profits where applicable. The study involved co-investigators with strong connections to southern WV, an area with limited resources for RADx-UP Phase One. Additionally, this study conducted a pilot study to examine the performance of the ABBOTT ID Now isothermal PCR system in 600 participants. Effect of the intervention was evaluated through monitoring of pre and post testing rate for the county using spatial regression analyses. A unique attribute of the statistical framework that proposed to evaluate the testing strategy was an ability to describe the impact on nearby counties in addition to the targeted community. This project leveraged existing and developed its own unique partnerships with local and state agencies for implementation of a community engaged testing delivery model within vaccine deserts.

For those not vaccinated for COVID, regular COVID-19 screening testing is recommended even when asymptomatic for those with frequent close contact with others in indoor settings such as FEW. However, BLH-FEW experience serious impediments to COVID-19 testing and testing
rates are lower among BLH than White populations. This community-engaged study was led by a collaborative team at New York University and the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation (NMIC). Its main goal was to optimize a behavioral intervention to boost COVID-19 testing rates for BLH-FEW. Consistent with RFA-OD-21-008, the study used the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to test four candidate intervention components grounded in past research. Participants will be N=448 BLH-FEW who have not been tested for COVID-19 in the past six months and who are not vaccinated for COVID-19, randomly assigned to an intervention condition, and assessed at 6- and 12-weeks post-baseline.",2022

In Louisiana, some of the greatest health and economic consequences are evident in Black communities. Furthermore, despite the widespread availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, approximately 30% of the US population reports that they will not get vaccinated, and Black citizens and those with lower socio-economic status are more likely to have vaccine hesitancy. Thus, there is an urgent need to address vaccine hesitancy within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current testing environment. The Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science (LA CaTS) Center provides the essential infrastructure and key foundational support for biomedical research in the region and is uniquely positioned to lead a community-engaged research project to determine solutions to decrease vaccine hesitancy and improve testing rates in the most underserved populations. Faith-based organizations (churches, mosques, temples, etc.) are trusted sources of information, especially among Black communities, and may represent an opportunity to convey accurate, unbiased health information regarding COVID-19 vaccinations and testing to the community. Many Black churches have well-developed health ministries that integrate faith and health for their members and the communities they serve. This study used a mixed-methods study design to determine the effectiveness of training church health ministers to educate their congregations about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for decreasing vaccine hesitancy and improving testing knowledge in underserved Black communities. The study randomized 98 participants from five churches to an intervention group that received counseling from their health ministers on the benefits of getting vaccinated and tested, or to a delayed intervention control group. The effects of the intervention on the primary outcome, vaccine hesitancy measured by a questionnaire, were administered to both groups after three weeks. Following the three-week control period, the delayed intervention control group also received the intervention and again administered the questionnaire. The study then conducted focus groups among a sub-sample of participants to obtain more granular information on sources of vaccine hesitancy and for their vaccine-related decisions. The achievement of the study's goals significantly increased the understanding of vaccine hesitancy within Black urban communities in Louisiana. The results informed the development of targeted interventions to increase vaccine coverage in the large, underserved populations across the American South.",2023

Risk communication was used as a tool to educate the community on the benefits of the testing program, while addressing social, behavioral, and ethical concerns for testing and vaccine hesitancy to prepare them for vaccine readiness. The study had three aims and involved a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) where K-5 elementary schools were the unit of randomization. The study collaborated with Yakima School District in the Yakima area and planned to enroll at least 900 participants. Aim 1.

Analyzing data collected from SARS-CoV-2 test results of students returning to in-person learning in the Yakima School District, combined with risk communication, may provide a mechanism to identify outbreaks early and stop transmission, as well as provide reassurance to families and to staff about the safety of on-site instruction. Risk communication was used as a tool to educate the community on the benefits of the testing program, while addressing social, behavioral, and ethical concerns for testing and vaccine hesitancy to prepare them for vaccine readiness. The study had three aims and involved a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) where K-5 elementary schools were the unit of randomization. The study collaborated with Yakima School District in the Yakima area and planned to enroll at least 900 participants. Aim 1. Identify the rural Latino community's social, ethical, behavioral needs and resources for students to return to school and maintain onsite learning using qualitative assessments with school stakeholders, parents, and students. Aim 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of risk communication on student attendance using a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two intervention arms: current learning model (comparison) and risk communication).

Analyzing data collected from SARS-CoV-2 test results of students returning to in-person learning in the Yakima School District, combined with risk communication, may provide a mechanism to identify outbreaks early and stop transmission, as well as provide reassurance to families and to staff about the safety of on-site instruction. Risk communication was used as a tool to educate the community on the benefits of the testing program, while addressing social, behavioral, and ethical concerns for testing and vaccine hesitancy to prepare them for vaccine readiness. The study had three aims and involved a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) where K-5 elementary schools were the unit of randomization. The study collaborated with Yakima School District in the Yakima area and planned to enroll at least 900 participants. Aim 1. Identify the rural Latino community's social, ethical, behavioral needs and resources for students to return to school and maintain onsite learning using qualitative assessments with school stakeholders, parents, and students. Aim 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of risk communication on student attendance using a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two intervention arms: current learning model (comparison) and risk communication). Prior to launching Aim 2, a pilot study was conducted in April-June 2021 with one school to understand the implementation steps and workflow. The larger RCT trial was implemented in 14 elementary schools in Fall 2021-Spring 2022 school year. Schools were randomized to receive the intervention (risk communication) or serve as a comparison or control group (continue the current practice). Participants in the intervention group received comic books once every three months. Participants randomly selected into the control group were given comic books at the end of the study. Parents of participants randomized to the Intervention group were given two health educational videos focused on COVID-19 throughout the school year. Caregivers of participants randomized to the control group received the two videos at the end of the study period. Primary outcomes for children were absenteeism (hours per week missing onsite learning). Secondary outcomes were assessed via surveys with 300 parents, with 150 parents of children from the control and 150 parents of children from the intervention group. Parents were asked about their children's physical activity and emotional regulation; parents were assessed for their perceived stress, COVID-related stress, and depressive symptomatology. Secondary outcome survey assessments were optional and offered to participants to be completed at time of enrollment, halfway through the study, and towards the end of the school year. Parents were provided the option to have their children enrolled in the Yakima School District's weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing program, separate from the study. There wase a Data Use Agreement (DTUA) with the Yakima School District's approval to access the SARS-CoV-2 test results of students enrolled in the research study. Access to student test information and results allowed the team to observe the effect that participation in weekly COVID-19 testing had on the primary and secondary outcomes that were assessed in this study.

Analyzing data collected from SARS-CoV-2 test results of students returning to in-person learning in the Yakima School District, combined with risk communication, may provide a mechanism to identify outbreaks early and stop transmission, as well as provide reassurance to families and to staff about the safety of on-site instruction. Risk communication was used as a tool to educate the community on the benefits of the testing program, while addressing social, behavioral, and ethical concerns for testing and vaccine hesitancy to prepare them for vaccine readiness. The study had three aims and involved a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) where K-5 elementary schools were the unit of randomization. The study collaborated with Yakima School District in the Yakima area and planned to enroll at least 900 participants. Aim 1. Identify the rural Latino community's social, ethical, behavioral needs and resources for students to return to school and maintain onsite learning using qualitative assessments with school stakeholders, parents, and students. Aim 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of risk communication on student attendance using a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two intervention arms: current learning model (comparison) and risk communication). Prior to launching Aim 2, a pilot study was conducted in April-June 2021 with one school to understand the implementation steps and workflow. The larger RCT trial was implemented in 14 elementary schools in Fall 2021-Spring 2022 school year. Schools were randomized to receive the intervention (risk communication) or serve as a comparison or control group (continue the current practice). Participants in the intervention group received comic books once every three months. Participants randomly selected into the control group were given comic books at the end of the study. Parents of participants randomized to the Intervention group were given two health educational videos focused on COVID-19 throughout the school year. Caregivers of participants randomized to the control group received the two videos at the end of the study period. Primary outcomes for children were absenteeism (hours per week missing onsite learning). Secondary outcomes were assessed via surveys with 300 parents, with 150 parents of children from the control and 150 parents of children from the intervention group. Parents were asked about their children's physical activity and emotional regulation; parents were assessed for their perceived stress, COVID-related stress, and depressive symptomatology. Secondary outcome survey assessments were optional and offered to participants to be completed at time of enrollment, halfway through the study, and towards the end of the school year.

Schools were randomized to receive the intervention (risk communication) or serve as a comparison or control group (continue the current practice). Participants in the intervention group received comic books once every three months. Participants randomly selected into the control group were given comic books at the end of the study. Parents of participants randomized to the Intervention group were given two health educational videos focused on COVID-19 throughout the school year. Caregivers of participants randomized to the control group received the two videos at the end of the study period. Primary outcomes for children were absenteeism (hours per week missing onsite learning). Secondary outcomes were assessed via surveys with 300 parents, with 150 parents of children from the control and 150 parents of children from the intervention group. Parents were asked about their children's physical activity and emotional regulation; parents were assessed for their perceived stress, COVID-related stress, and depressive symptomatology. Secondary outcome survey assessments were optional and offered to participants to be completed at time of enrollment, halfway through the study, and towards the end of the school year. Parents were provided the option to have their children enrolled in the Yakima School District's weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing program, separate from the study. There wase a Data Use Agreement (DTUA) with the Yakima School District's approval to access the SARS-CoV-2 test results of students enrolled in the research study. Access to student test information and results allowed the team to observe the effect that participation in weekly COVID-19 testing had on the primary and secondary outcomes that were assessed in this study. Aim 3. Assess implementation outcomes of the program with school stakeholders, parents, and children guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. Aim 3 occurred after Aim 1 and 2 were completed.",2022

C3 Criminal Legal Involved (CLI) populations encompassed those non-incarcerated who have experienced recent arrest, incarceration, probation, parole or diversion programs such as drug courts. While increases in COVID-19 testing have been observed among this group, there remain members with limited testing history as well as individuals who are vaccine hesitant. COVID-19 prevention messaging can no longer be simplified to “everyone test and/or everyone vaccinate” as testing and vaccination decisions among community members are sensitive to personal histories (i.e., prior infection), local infection rates (i.e., low rates) and testing/vaccination availability. As COVID-19 prevention efforts have become more complicated (i.e., test if exposed), people tend to focus on the messenger, and particularly those that are close to them. Personal connections and communications within existing personal network structures, such as families, friends and other trusted acquaintances represent the cornerstone to increase situation appropriate testing and overcoming COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. C3 built upon RADx-UP I, by using a network diffusion approach facilitated through motivational interviewing purposefully geared to mobilize one’s own organic social network to increase context appropriate testing and vaccine uptake. Through this process, the study maximized the primary benefit and impact of this type of intervention which also has the intended effect of increasing likelihood that the messenger themselves will undergo the same behavior change that they have been trained to promote. The study leveraged infrastructure developed in RADx-UP Phase I, which included 4 high-impact sites across the Central US from Phase I: Baton Rouge LA, Little Rock AR, Indianapolis IN, and Chicago IL. The study utilized established engagement efforts already in place and continue to fully integrate communities in the strategic application of the intervention. The study used the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework to guide implementation. C3 aims to: Aim 1a. Test the efficacy (3-month situation appropriate testing or vaccination) of a network diffusion intervention (C3) versus an existing COVID-19 testing and vaccine linkage to care intervention among: 1) primary study participants (primary outcome); and 2) secondary study participants connected to primary participants (secondary outcome) using a RCT design. Aim 1b. Explore the mechanisms for differential intervention effects at the individual and network-level that may increase situation appropriate testing and/or vaccination uptake. Aim 2. Examine key RE-AIM components in real time tied to the implementation of the network diffusion intervention (C3).",2022

Utilizing the integrated research collaborative framework that facilitates dialogue among researchers, community members, and service providers as a tool for optimizing the adaptive intervention, this study took place at the North Jersey Community Research Initiative (NJCRI). The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) was used to optimize an adaptive intervention that successfully navigates COVID-19 medically or socially vulnerable people through a continuum of prevention, care and treatment (CoPCT) modeled on the HIV CoPCT. The COVID-19 CoPCT starts with testing and continues with successful adherence to prevention or treatment guidelines to help prevent and/or treat COVID-19. The study assessed the effectiveness of Navigation Services compared to referrals in increasing COVID-19 testing and Brief Counseling in increasing adherence to the State of NJ recommendations for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. The effect of Critical Dialogue on testing behavior among people who decline to be tested for COVID-19 was also examined. The investigators developed decision rules about what evidence-based-interventions work best for what types of people (e.g., those who test right away, versus decliners) and in what period of the COVID-19 continuum.

The goals of this study were to: (1) identify ethical concerns and potential solutions for COVID-19 testing and vaccine strategies in correctional facilities using a community-engaged strategy, and (2) characterize incidence of COVID-19, disease progression, and related-outcomes and effectiveness of testing and contact tracing in correctional facilities. Potential subjects had to be incarcerated at key facilities in Washington, Rhode Island, Minnesota, and Florida at the time of recruitment. These facilities were Everglades Correctional Institution and Homestead Correctional Institution in Florida, Shakopee and Stillwater correctional facilities in Minnesota, the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, and Yakima County Jail in Washington. Participating correctional facilities in Florida, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Washington provided de-identified data on approximately 16,859 incarcerated adults and correctional staff. Data sources included de-identified data from medical records, administrative data, and policy documents pertaining to COVID-19. Three series of focus groups (6, 12, 18 months) across three distinct groups (incarcerated people, medical providers, and correctional leaders) and four sites amounted to 36 total focus groups over the study period. 74,812 COVID-19 tests were utilized to test and 16,859 incarcerated people and correctional staff were re-tested for active infection over a six-month period in the FL, MN, and RI state prison systems and the Yakima County Jail in WA.",2022

The goal was to identify barriers and facilitators to develop strategies to improve testing in these under-served populations by: Increasing the reach, access, uptake, and impact of COVID-19 testing among incarcerated people and staff in prison and jails. Individuals in congregate settings have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with correctional settings accounting for 39 of the 50 largest cluster outbreaks in the country to date. Schema of Correctional Facilities: Correctional facilities are amplifiers of infectious diseases for structural reasons: 1) Dormitory-style living and overcrowded conditions make social distancing nearly impossible 2) They have a focus primarily on security not health 3) Their medical departments are under-resourced and often disconnected from local public health agencies. Correctional facilities must be the focus of urgent intervention to understand the incidence of COVID-19, how it spreads in correctional facilities, and durable long-term strategies to reduce transmission, including testing and vaccines. However, the work from the COVID Prison Project showed that correctional systems have implemented a range of testing strategies, without coordination, such that synthesizing the information on COVID-19 incidence, outcomes and optimal testing strategies (including repeat testing and contact tracing) has been challenging. Incarcerated people decline testing due to concerns about confidentiality, implications for release, and fear of placement in solitary confinement.

Not only are they at dramatically higher risk of becoming infected with Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and death from COVID-19, but children with IDD are vulnerable to the negative impact of school closure. School districts provide critical services beyond the education, including nutritional, social, therapy (physical, occupational, and speech-language) and healthcare services. Risks are heightened for children with IDD, as they are often unable to wear masks, practice social distancing and/or implement effective hand hygiene. Access to rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 testing is essential for children with IDD and school staff in order to safely return to school. Members of the research team have developed an innovative, scalable, low-cost method for SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva samples. Investigators at the Washington University Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC@WUSTL), in collaboration with the University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute of Human Development and the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Maryland (which includes an IDDRC, the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities, and the Kennedy Krieger School Programs), are ideally positioned to determine the best implementation strategies to maximize use of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test for vulnerable children and school staff in a school setting. The IDDRC@WUSTL has a long-standing relationship with the Special School District (SSD) of St. Louis County, whose mission is to serve children with IDD, and the national network of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD). First, the most effective messaging and implementation strategies to maximize weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing in a school setting were determined. In this adaptive clinical trial, 52,000 diagnostic tests to students and school staff at SSD, whose student population is 48% Black were administered. Second, the study measured national attitudes among parents/guardians of children with IDD and school staff regarding the impact of COVID-19 and the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing. At the successful completion of this project, the study improved the acceptance, adoption, and process for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing in a school-based setting to enable delivery of critical educational activities for children with IDD in an underserved community.

In Aim 1, the project evaluated implementation of a Latino Task Force (LTF) collaborative network across 3 counties in California (Marin, Merced and San Francisco), adapted from San Francisco's LTF model to promote locally-adapted COVID-19 test and respond initiatives in two majority-Latinx communities: one suburban (Marin) and one rural (Merced). In Aim 2, the project determined the population-level prevalence of active (PCR+) SARS-CoV-2 infection, most at-risk subgroups, and attitudes and preferences of community members regarding COVID-19 testing services during baseline mass testing campaigns at the Marin and Merced sites.
